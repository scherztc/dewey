1.  Subject Terms (Keyword)

    -  Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
    -  Python using RAKE and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
    module, with a character minimum of 5, a phrase maximum of 3 words,
    and a minimum word frequency of 4 words. The SMART stop list was used instead, which contains 571
    words. 
    -  DBPedia Spotlight22 / Aho-Corasick algorithm

1.  Clustering
    -  Weka to test Simple k-Means, one of the
    most popular clustering algorithms. k-Means partitions a set of documents
    into k clusters where each document belongs to the cluster with the nearest
    mean. 
    -  To start, the algorithm will randomly choose “centroids” for
    each cluster, then iteratively recalculate the position of those centroids
    until either there is no change in position or some set number of iterations
    has been reached. 
    -  Identifying meaningful relationships is a matter of
    trial and error, adjusting the value of k and then reviewing the composition
    of each cluster.
