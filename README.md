# Regulation

MEPs substantially amended the list to include bans on intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI systems such as:


1.  “Real-time” remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces;
1.  “Post” remote biometric identification systems, with the only exception of law enforcement for the prosecution of serious crimes and only after judicial authorization;
1.  Biometric categorisation systems using sensitive characteristics (e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, religion, political orientation);
1.  Predictive policing systems (based on profiling, location or past criminal behaviour);
1.  Emotion recognition systems in law enforcement, border management, workplace, and educational institutions; and
1.  Indiscriminate scraping of biometric data from social media or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases (violating human rights and right to privacy).

-  Reinforcment Learning : data - > model
-  Cumulative Selection : Building off the last step.  Not starting over everyt ime
-  Semi-Supervisied Machine Learning : Supervised means there is some human involvement in setting up the tool,
-  Inductive Reasoning
   -   The corpus-based approach using a training set, as described above, uses the process of inductive reasoning. This is the kind of thinking that states ‘the sun rose yesterday, the sun rose today, so the chances are the sun will rise tomorrow’. Now, philosophers will argue that inductive reasoning is not scientific. Just because the sun rose yesterday does not mean the sun will rise tomorrow.

   - A Test Set : collection of documents to be used for trialling the algorithm, to see how successfully it carries out the operation.

   - An Algorithm : The ‘algorithm’ is simply the tool that looks at each item in the corpus and enables a decision to be made. An algorithm may be as simple (and frequently is as simple) as matching a pattern. selecting and applying an algorithm or method

# AI Methodology
   1.Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)
Evolutionary Algorithms are a subset of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. They are used to solve complex optimization problems by evolving 
solutions over generations. Key concepts and components include:

Population: A set of candidate solutions.
Selection: The process of choosing the fittest individuals based on a fitness function.
Crossover: Combining parts of two or more solutions to create offspring.
Mutation: Introducing random variations to solutions to maintain genetic diversity.
Fitness Function: A measure of how well a solution solves the problem.
EAs are particularly useful for problems where the search space is large, complex, or poorly understood. They have applications in areas such as engineering design, scheduling, and machine 
learning model optimization.

   1.Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
Deep Reinforcement Learning combines reinforcement learning with deep learning. It involves training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Key 
components include:

Agent: The entity making decisions.
Environment: The world with which the agent interacts.
State: A representation of the environment at any given time.
Action: Choices available to the agent.
Reward: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.
Policy: A strategy used by the agent to decide actions based on states.
Value Function: Estimates the expected return of states or actions.
DRL is particularly powerful for tasks involving sequential decision-making, where the environment is dynamic and complex. Applications include robotics, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), autonomous 
vehicles, and financial trading.

Relationship and Differences
Evolutionary Algorithms focus on optimization through population-based search and are often used for static optimization problems.
Deep Reinforcement Learning emphasizes learning optimal policies through interaction with dynamic environments, leveraging neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
