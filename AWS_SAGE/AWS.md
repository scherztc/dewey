# Regulation

MEPs substantially amended the list to include bans on intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI systems such as:


1.  “Real-time” remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces;
1.  “Post” remote biometric identification systems, with the only exception of law enforcement for the prosecution of serious crimes and only after judicial authorization;
1.  Biometric categorisation systems using sensitive characteristics (e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, religion, political orientation);
1.  Predictive policing systems (based on profiling, location or past criminal behaviour);
1.  Emotion recognition systems in law enforcement, border management, workplace, and educational institutions; and
1.  Indiscriminate scraping of biometric data from social media or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases (violating human rights and right to privacy).
