This dissertation consists of two studies. Study one examined knowledge, attitudes,
behavioral intentions and past behaviors of young adults with regard to e-cigarettes. Study two
examined the influence of internet information on young adults’ perceptions about e-cigarettes.

Study One Abstract
Awareness and use of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) is growing among young adults in the United
States, despite increasing evidence of health risks associated them. Thus, the purpose of this study
was to assess young adults’ e-cig use, their knowledge of risks, their attitudes, their behavioral
intentions regarding e-cig use and the relationship between these variables. A four-page, 42-item
survey was developed to determine participants’ knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and
past behaviors with regard to e-cigs. Analyses revealed that about 39% of young adults had used
e-cigs and use was more common in males than females. Furthermore, about 66% of respondents
indicated a desire to try an e-cig within the next month. Positive attitudes towards e-cigs was found

ii

to be a significant predictor of e-cig use while knowledge was not a significant predictor. These
findings should be considered in interventions to prevent e-cig use and its associated health risks
among young adults. Public health researchers can utilize results of this study as a background
information for future investigations of e-cig use by young adult college students.

Study Two Abstract
Young adults have the highest rate of internet use among the adult population. Thus, they
are potentially exposed to online e-cig marketing information which may affect their knowledge
of risks, attitudes and behavioral intentions related to e-cigs. Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to examine exposure to e-cig advertisements among young adults and to assess the effect of
exposure to e-cig advertisements on their knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions. Analyses
revealed that about 44% of the participants had viewed e-cig advertisements on the internet.
Analyses also revealed that males had more knowledge and more positive attitudes towards e-cigs
than females. Nevertheless, exposure to e-cig advertisements did not significantly influence
knowledge, attitudes or behavioral intentions. These findings should be considered in interventions
to regulate information about e-cigs that are transmitted to young adults through the internet. Study
results also contribute to existing knowledge about the influence of internet information on young
adult e-cig perceptions and highlight the need for further research to increase understanding of the
relationship between exposure to e-cig information on the internet and young adult e-cig
perceptions.

Study One: Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavioral Intentions and Past Behavior of Young Adults
with Regard to Electronic Cigarettes

Introduction
An electronic cigarette (e-cigarette or e-cig) is a battery-operated Electronic Nicotine
Delivery System (ENDS) that delivers vaporized nicotine without combusting tobacco like a
regular cigarette (World Health Organization, 2009). Since its development in 2004, the popularity
and use of e-cigs have continued to increase among young adults. King, Patel, Nguyen, and Dube
(2014) found that the percentage of adults who are aware of e-cigs nearly doubled, from 40.9% in
2010 to 79.7% in 2013. During this period, the percentage of adults who smoked an e-cig more
than doubled from 3.3% to 8.5%. By 2014, 12.6% of all adults in the United States had tried an ecig (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). Among the adult population, young
adults have the highest rate of e-cig use. According to the CDC (2015), 21.6% of U.S. young adults
(18-24 years) have used an e-cig, compared to 16.6% for adults in mid-adulthood (25-44 years),
10.2% for older adults (45-64 years), and 3.7% for the elderly (65 years and above).
Research has found that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in e-cig use
among young adults. Males were found to be more likely to use e-cigs than females, with use
highest during young adulthood and declining gradually with increasing age (CDC, 2015;
Chapman & Wu, 2014; Littlefield, Gottlieb, Cohen, & Trotter, 2015; Piñeiro et al., 2016; Suftin et
al., 2013). This is similar to current research showing that males are more likely to use tobacco
products than females (Cullen et al., 2011; King, Dube, & Tynan, 2012; Rath, Villanti, Abrams,
& Vallone, 2012). Use of e-cigs was also found to vary based on ethnicity. The most current CDC
(2015) data brief on e-cig use among US adults showed that adults who identified as American
Indian or Alaska Native reported the highest rate of e-cig use, followed by white non-Hispanics,
Hispanics, black non-Hispanics and Asians. Choi and Forster (2013) discovered that young adults

2

who had at least one close friend who smoked were more likely to know about and to have used
e-cigarettes while Suftin et al. (2013) found a higher rate of e-cig use among college students who
were members of sororities or fraternities.
The exponential increase in the popularity and use of e-cigs is a source of concern because
of the increasing evidence of several health issues associated with their use. One of these health
issues is nicotine toxicity. Nicotine toxicity, also known as nicotine poisoning, occurs when human
exposure to a high concentration of nicotine results in adverse health effects. Exposure to high
concentrations of nicotine commonly occurs either through the oral route (accidental or deliberate
ingestion) or the parenteral route (contact of liquid nicotine with the skin or by injection directly
into a blood vessel). Symptoms of toxicity include nausea and vomiting, excess oral secretions,
excessive sweating, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, confusion, convulsions, tachycardia (racing
heartbeats) or bradycardia (slow heartbeats) and hypertension or hypotension (CDC, 2013). Death
could also result from nicotine toxicity. Estimates of the lethal dose of nicotine range from 3060mg in adults and 10mg in children (Cameron et al., 2014). For reference, a regular cigarette
contains 10-14mg of nicotine (Benowitz et al., 2009) while a 5ml vial of e-liquid at a concentration
of 12mg/ml contains 60mg of nicotine.
Nicotine toxicity has become more common because of the high concentrations of nicotine
found in e-cigs and the inadequacy of regulations to protect people from nicotine poisoning. In
fact, calls to poison centers for nicotine poisoning related to e-cig use increased from one per
month in 2010 up to 215 per month in 2014 (CDC, 2014). Possible nicotine poisoning related to
e-cig use in adults accounted for about half of the calls to poison centers in 2013 (Vakkalanka,
Hardison, & Holstege, 2014). The Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2016 provides

3

protection for children (Consumer Federation of America, 2016). In addition, the recent United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule on all ENDS, which was concluded on 10th May
2016 and which becomes effective on the eighth of August 2016, prevents their sale to people
under the age of 18 years (United States Food and Drug Administration, 2016; The Office of the
Federal Register, 2016). However, these legislations do not address nicotine poisoning issues in
adults.
Additionally, several studies have shown that e-cigs contain substances which can cause
lung diseases and cancer. Jensen et al. (2015) discovered that a long-term e-cig smoker could be
exposed to up to 15 times more formaldehyde – which is known to be a toxin, allergen and
carcinogen – than the exposure for a long-term cigarette smoker. Another laboratory analysis
conducted by Allen et al. (2015) on e-liquid contents from 51 brands of e-cigs revealed that 47
brands contained one or more of diacetyl, acetylpropionyl (2, 3 – pentanedione) and acetoin. All
three chemicals can cause severe respiratory disease. Williams et al. (2013) conducted laboratory
analyses of 22 e-cig cartomizers and found that e-cig smoke contained several substances (silicate,
metal particles and metal nanoparticles) that can cause respiratory disease and cancer.
Furthermore, nicotine in e-cigs can lead to addiction and serve as a “gateway” to the use
of other tobacco products and other psychoactive substances. The gateway phenomenon, first
developed by Kandel (1975), identified a developmental sequence of drug use starting from legal
drugs and then moving on to illegal drugs. According to Kandel and Kandel (2014), the addictive
effect of nicotine modifies the human brain to become more inclined to seeking and developing
addiction to other psychoactive substances. Thus, Kandel and Kandel (2014) demonstrated that
there was a physiological mechanism by which nicotine dependence develops, which could

4

predispose those using nicotine to be vulnerable to using other psychoactive substances. Similarly,
there is a significant association between regular cigarette and e-cig use. For example, Littlefield
et al. (2015) discovered that young adult college students who used e-cigs were more likely to be
dual e-cig and regular cigarette users, and they were more likely to use both types of cigarettes
more heavily compared to those who have never used an e-cig. These findings were corroborated
by other authors (Choi & Forster, 2014; Giovenco, Lewis, & Delnevo, 2014; Primack et al., 2015).
Knowledge and awareness about risks can play a great role in determining people’s
attitudes towards a particular behavior. According to Ajzen (1991), people’s attitudes towards a
particular behavior result from a combination of their beliefs about what will happen if they engage
in the behavior and their assessment of whether the outcome of the behavior is beneficial or
detrimental. The knowledge that a person possesses about a behavior, in turn, determines his or
her belief and outcome assessment. With regard to e-cigs, Suftin et al. (2013) discovered that use
was associated with less knowledge about harm potential. Also, Choi and Forster (2013) found
that many young adults in their sample were aware of the existence of e-cigs (69.9%). Nonetheless,
unsubstantiated information about e-cigs was rampant among the respondents – about 53% agreed
that e-cigs are less harmful than regular cigarettes, about 44% agreed that e-cigs can help one to
quit smoking, and about 26% agreed that cigarettes are less addictive than regular cigarettes. Also,
Coleman et al. (2015) found that young adult attitudes were in support of e-cigs and Pokhrel et al.
(2016) found that positive attitudes to e-cigs were predictive of e-cig use. These findings suggest
that accurate knowledge about risks related to e-cig use is low and attitudes towards e-cig are
positive among young adults, which may further explain why rates of e-cig use are rapidly rising
among this population.

5

Due to the public health issues associated with e-cigs and the rapidly rising rate of use
among young adults, it is important to study variables related to young adults’ e-cig use, including
their knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and reasons for use. This is essential to gain an
understanding of what is related to use in order to develop more comprehensive prevention
messages. Also, understanding groups at risk for e-cig use can help health professionals target
prevention messages to high risk groups. Therefore, the focus of this research is to assess young
adults’ e-cig use as well as their knowledge of risks, their attitudes and their behavioral intentions
regarding e-cig use as these are also key predictors of e-cig use (Choi & Forster, 2014; Suftin et
al., 2013).
A number of theories are consistent with the notion that individual level factors, such as
knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions are linked to e-cig use. One of these theories is the
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by Ajzen (1991). Understanding the links between individual
level factors, knowledge of e-cig use, attitudes, and intentions will provide important information
for those designing prevention messages. Therefore, the following study had the following
research aims and questions:

The aims of this study are:
1. To assess knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and past behaviors of young adult
college students with regard to e-cigs.
2. To determine the relations among demographic variables, attitudes, behavioral intentions
and e-cig smoking.

6

These research questions were examined:
1. What is the rate of e-cig use among young adult college students based on demographic
factors (age, gender and race/ethnicity)?
2. What is the extent of knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions about e-cigs by young
adult college students?
3. What is the relationship between gender, knowledge, attitudes and e-cig use among young
adult college students?
Methods
Participants
Participants in this study were college students attending a large urban public research
university in the Midwestern region of the United States. The total enrolment of students at the
main campus of university during the fall 2015 semester when the data were collected was 36,067
(University of Cincinnati, 2015). This number was large enough to produce a normal (binomial)
distribution and therefore 95% of this distribution’s probability lay within two standard deviations
of the mean (95% confidence level). Thus, the least representative sample size for this population
using a sample size calculator (Raosoft, 2004) was 381. This sample size of 381 accounts for a
confidence interval of 95% or a margin of error of five percent and is the minimum representative
sample size required to provide enough power for the study. A sample of 420 participants provided
data for this study in the fall semester of 2015. This study was approved by a university-based
institutional review board and the approval letter is presented in Appendix A.

Instrument
A four-page, 42-item survey was used to collect data for this study (see Appendix B). The
survey was developed through a review of literature (Chapman & Wu, 2014; Choi & Forster, 2013;
Choi & Forster, 2014; Littlefield et al., 2015), review of other standardized surveys used for
assessing youth tobacco product use (Georgia Department of Public Health, 2013), consultation
with professionals knowledgeable about tobacco control and substance abuse prevention, and
discussion with college students. The survey was comprised of five sections – (1) Knowledge
about e-cigs, (2) Attitudes and beliefs concerning e-cigs, (3) E-cig and regular cigarette use, (4)
Online e-cig information, and (5) Demographic information.
Section 1 (questions 1 to 7) assessed the level of knowledge and awareness about e-cigs.
This section was presented in form of a table that assessed the respondents’ perceptions of their
level of knowledge for seven questions. Students provided responses to the questions on 5-point
Likert scales: 1 – “Strongly Agree”, 2 – “Agree”, 3 – “Neutral”, 4 – “Disagree”, and 5 – “Strongly
Disagree”. Question 1 assessed whether respondents knew that an e-cigarette is an electronic
version of a regular cigarette while question 2 assessed the students’ knowledge about whether ecigs contain the same substances as a regular cigarettes. Question 3 sought to determine whether
respondents knew that e-cig vapor does not consist of only water vapor while question 4 assessed
whether respondents were aware of the risk of nicotine addiction associated with e-cigs. Question
5 asked if e-cigs are safe for anyone to use, question 6 asked if e-cigs produced second-hand smoke
and 7 assessed participants’ knowledge about nicotine poisoning associated with e-cig use.
Section 2 assessed participants’ attitudes about using e-cigs. Ten of the questions examined
several constructs including: beliefs about using e-cigs, perceived benefits and risks of use, and

8

outcome expectations for e-cig use. Students again provided responses on 5-point scales from: 1 –
“Strongly Agree”, 2 – “Agree”, 3 – “Neutral”, 4 – “Disagree”, and 5 – “Strongly Disagree”.
Questions 8, 13, 14, and 17 dealt with beliefs about policies regarding e-cig purchase and use,
while questions 9 and 11 addressed beliefs related to e-cig safety. Questions 10 and 12 sought to
assess respondents’ beliefs about the social value or appeal of e-cigs while question 15 assessed
respondents’ stance on whether e-cigs can be used to help people to quit smoking. Question 16
assessed respondents’ beliefs about the relationship between the use of e-cigs and regular
cigarettes. Question 18 gauged the respondents’ beliefs about several factors that could influence
e-cig use, including safety, price, ease of purchase, flavors, appearance, variety of shapes and sizes,
different levels of nicotine content, health benefits, and hygienic benefits. Question 18 had 9
options (see Table 1) and participants checked a box to indicate “Yes” or left it unchecked to
indicate “No” to each of the response options.
Insert Table 1 here
Section 3 (questions 19-26) assessed current and past use of e-cigs, intentions to use e-cigs,
the effect of peer pressure (subjective norms) and the means by which respondents acquired ecigs. All the questions in this section were adapted from the 2013 Georgia Youth Tobacco Survey
(Georgia Department of Public Health, 2013) and modified for e-cigs. Question 19 assessed
whether the respondent had ever tried smoking an e-cig (“yes” or “no”). Question 20 sought to
determine the age at which respondents first used an e-cig, if they had used it. For question 20,
participants could only choose one of 5 answer options: 1 - “I have never smoked an e-cigarette,
not even one or two puffs”, 2 – “8 years or younger”, 3 – “9 – 12 years old”, 4 – “13 – 17 years
old”, and 5 – “18 years or older”. Question 21 assessed current (past 30 day) use of e-cigs and

9

participants had 7 options indicating how many days they had smoked e-cigs within the past 30
days: 1 – “0 days”, 2 – “1 or 2 days”, 3 – “3 to 5 days”, 4 – “6 to 9 days”, 5 – “10 to 19 days”, 6 –
“20 to 29 days” and 7 – “All 30 days”. Participants could only choose one of the 7 options on
question 21. Questions 22 and 23 assessed methods and means of obtaining e-cigs and each
question had multiple options from which respondents could choose one or more than one (see
table 2 and table 3 below). Participants indicated whether their answer was true or false for each
option and could provide additional explanatory information if they wished.
Insert Tables 2 and 3 here
Question 24 assessed intention to use an e-cig in the future, and had 3 options: 1 – “I have
already tried smoking e-cigs”, 2 – “Yes”, and 3 – “No”. Question 25 assessed the extent of
influence of peer pressure on e-cig use and had 4 options: 1 – “Definitely yes”, 2 – “Probably yes”,
3 – “Probably not”, and 4 – “Definitely not”. The last question in this section (question 26) assessed
current (within 30 days) or past regular cigarette smoking. It had 7 options: 1 – “I have never
smoked regular cigarettes, not even one or two puffs”, 2 – “Earlier today”, 3 – “Not today but
sometime during the past 7 days”, 4 – “Not during the past 7 days but sometime during the past
30 days”, 5 – “Not during the past 30 days but sometime during the past 6 months”, 6 – “Not
during the past 6 months but sometime during the past year”, and 7 – “1 or more years”.
Section 4 (questions 27-32) assessed the extent of exposure of the respondents to online ecig information in order to determine the extent of influence of this information on e-cig use.
Section 5 was designed to elicit demographic information. The 10 questions in this section assessed
age (33), gender (34), ethnicity (35), academic level (36), enrollment status (37 – full or part time),

10

place of residence (39 and 40), Greek society affiliation (41), Grade Point Average (42), and
employment status (38).
Procedures
Fifteen professors from different colleges at the university were contacted through e-mail
and their permission was sought to recruit students from their classes. Once permission was
granted, the principal investigator went to the classrooms and asked the students if they wanted to
participate in the study. A total of 20 classrooms were visited. Students were given an Information
Sheet (see Appendix C) to review study procedures, the voluntary nature of the study, and to
provide contact information for the investigator and information about how to contact
representatives of the Institutional Review Board. The Information Sheet also described the
voluntary nature of participation in the study and specified that completing and returning the
survey would indicate their consent to participate in the study. Surveys did not contain any names
or identifying information. After reviewing the Information Sheet, participants completed the
survey, which took five to ten minutes. Participants’ anonymity was preserved by instructing them
not to put their names or any other identifying information on the survey.
A test-retest reliability study was performed by having 30 participants complete the survey
twice, one week apart. Prior to participating in this part of the study, students reviewed an
Information Sheet for the Test-Retest Study (Appendix D) and this specified the purpose,
procedures, and confidential nature of this study. The Information Sheet provided contact
information for the investigator and representatives from the Institutional Review Board. This form
also specified the voluntary nature of the study and that returning the surveys would indicate study
participation. Students who participated in the test-retest study were each assigned an identification

11

number which they wrote on their surveys. The identification number was the same for each
student for the first and second administration of the surveys.
Data Analysis
Data from the surveys were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) (Version 22.0). To examine the test-retest reliability of the survey instruments, percentage
agreement between test and retest survey responses were calculated for questions with “yes” or
“no” options, while bivariate correlations were used for questions with Likert scale-type options.
Descriptive information about study participants were presented using frequencies and
percentages to describe categorical variables (e.g., ethnic group and sex) and measures of central
tendency (means, standard deviations) were used to describe numerical variables (e.g., age).
Information about rate of e-cig use and knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions about ecigs were also presented using descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, and measures of
central tendency).
Bivariate correlations were used to explore the relationships among questions assessing
knowledge and attitudes. Knowledge items were found to be correlated and thus were combined
into a mean score. Attitude items were also found to be correlated and were also combined into a
mean attitudes score. Also, the question assessing intention to use e-cig (question 24) was recoded
into “yes” and “I have already tried smoking e-cigs” = 1 and “no” = 0 for the analysis.
Furthermore, the relationship between gender, knowledge, attitudes, and use of e-cigs was
determined by regression analyses. The best fit model is presented as the interaction terms were
not significant and did not add to the predictive power of the model.

Results
Test-Retest Reliability
Percentage agreement and Pearson’s correlations (r) were used to assess the agreement
between responses at both time periods for questions assessing variables used for analysis in this
study. Results showed 100% agreement for questions assessing use of e-cigs (questions 19, 20 and
21) and 96.7% agreement for intention to smoke an e-cig within the next month. Analyses also
revealed statistically significant Pearson’s correlations (p < 0.05) between test and retest responses
for Likert-type scale questions assessing knowledge (questions 1 – 7) and attitudes (questions 8 –
17). Significant correlations are presented in Table 4.

Demographics
Demographic characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 5.
Insert Table 5 here
A total of 420 college students aged 17 to 24 years completed the survey. Mean age was about 20
years (M = 19.79, SD = 1.59). The majority (83.5%) of the respondents were White non-Hispanic
(n = 351) and about 51% were females (n = 213). About 58% lived off-campus (n = 244) and about
77% did not live with parents or guardians (n = 322). About 40% (n = 169) were freshmen, 17%
(n = 70) were sophomores, 20% (n = 82) were juniors, 23% (n = 96) were seniors and there was
one graduate student. Almost all the students (99.0%) were enrolled full-time (n = 414) and 44%
were unemployed (n = 186). About 18% (n = 74) were members of fraternities or sororities.

13

E-cig Use based on Age, Gender and Race/Ethnicity
Results presented in Table 6 showed that about 39% (n = 166) had used e-cigs. Of
participants who had ever tried e-cigs (n = 166), about 25% (n = 42) were current users (had used
an e-cig sometime within the past 30 days). Males accounted for 62% (n = 103) of e-cig users and
87.4% (n = 145) were White Non-Hispanic. The highest proportion of e-cig users (27.1%) were
aged 18 years at their last birthday (n = 45) and about 34% of e-cig users (n = 56) reported first
use before their 18th birthday.

Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions about E-Cigs
Means and standard deviations for knowledge and attitudes questions are presented in
Table 7. Correlations were used to analyze the relationship between questions assessing student
knowledge and attitudes. Tables 8 and 9 present the correlation coefficients for the knowledge and
attitudes questions. About 66% of the respondents (n = 276) indicated that they intended to use an
e-cig within the next month.

Relationship between Gender, Knowledge, Attitudes, and E-Cig Use
The best fit regression model for the relationship between demographic factors, knowledge,
attitudes, and e-cig use is presented in Table 10.
Insert Table 10 here
The regression model for the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, gender and e-cig
use was statistically significant (F = 24.467, df = 3, p < .001). The model accounted for about 16%

14

of the variance in e-cig use. Gender (B = .143, p = .002) and attitudes (B = .034, p < .001) were
significant predictors of e-cig use, while knowledge was not a significant predictor. The interaction
terms were not significant and were not included in the final model.
Discussion
This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and past behavior of
young adults with regard to use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Results indicated that e-cig use
was common among young adults. Findings also indicated that, on average, young adults had
moderate levels of knowledge about risks related to e-cigs and their attitudes were in support of ecigs. Findings from a regression analysis indicated that attitudes and gender predicted e-cig use
while knowledge did not. These findings provide evidence for the need for interventions to prevent
or reduce e-cig use in young adults due to the health risks associated with them. College students
need to be educated about the potential harms of e-cigs such as nicotine poisoning, nicotine
addiction and the potential for lung diseases and cancer (Allen et al., 2015; CDC, 2014; Jensen et
al., 2015; Vakkalanka, Hardison, & Holstege, 2014; Williams et al., 2013).
E-cig Use among Young Adults
The present study found that about 39% of young adults (n = 166) had used e-cigs in the
past, while about 13% of young adults (n = 42) were current (past 30-day) users. This is a high
proportion relative to a recent national study which reported the rate of past and current e-cig use
among young adults to be 21.6% and 5.1% respectively (CDC, 2015). Findings also showed that
more males (62%) than females (38%) used e-cigs. These findings are congruent with recent
studies showing that males are more likely to use e-cigs than females (Littlefield et al., 2015;

15

Piñeiro et al., 2016; Suftin et al., 2013). Rates of e-cig use were found to decrease with increasing
age; this finding was similar to results of previous studies (CDC, 2015; Chapman & Wu, 2014).
Furthermore, results of this study indicated that White, non-Hispanic students had the
highest rates of e-cig use (87% of e-cig users). However, it should be noted that other ethnic groups
accounted for a small proportion of the sample (16.5%). When adjusting for relative proportions
of each ethnicity, Native Americans had the highest adjusted rate of e-cig use (100%, n = 1)
followed by Biracial/Multiracial participants (73%, n = 11), White non-Hispanics (41%, n = 145),
Black non-Hispanics (20%, n = 5) and Asian/ Pacific Islanders (15%, n = 3). None of the five
Hispanic/Latino participants reported e-cig use. This is similar to CDC (2015) findings which
showed the rates of use to be highest among American Indian or Alaska Natives (Native
Americans), followed by White non-Hispanics, Hispanics (Latino), Black non-Hispanics and
Asians.
Extent of Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions of Young Adults about E-cigs
In terms of knowledge about e-cig use, young adults’ responses indicated mixed levels of
knowledge about e-cigs and their health effects. The mean scores for knowledge about e-cigs
showed that the average young adult disagreed that e-cigs are safe for anyone to use. On the other
hand, they agreed that people can get addicted to e-cigs. Average responses to other questions
assessing knowledge were close to the middle of the scale, implying that young adults were unsure
or did not know the answer to the questions. These findings contrast with those by Choi and Forster
(2013) which revealed that, though a large proportion (69.9%) of young adults were aware of ecigs, level of accurate knowledge about them was low. The mixed levels of knowledge may be
explained by the fact that many young adults lack accurate health information about e-cigs and

16

that they may be exposed to conflicting information from the media (visual and print) and at retail
outlets which often tout enticing information directed at luring the viewer to use the product
(Coleman et al., 2015).
Attitudes of young adults in this study about e-cigs tended to be favorable. They perceived
e-cigs to be less harmful to health than regular cigarettes and agreed that e-cigs can be used to help
people to quit smoking. About 66% of the respondents indicated that they intended to use an e-cig
within the next month. These findings are similar to studies (Coleman et al., 2015; Pokhrel et al.,
2016) that showed that young adults possessed favorable attitudes towards e-cigs. The high rate of
intentions to use e-cigs may be reflective of the favorable attitudes towards e-cigs. On the other
hand, young adults also favored regulations to restrict e-cig use and disagreed that people should
be allowed to smoke them inside public buildings or that people of any age should be able to buy
or use e-cigs.
Relationship between Gender, Knowledge, Attitudes and E-cig Use among Young Adults
Findings revealed that gender and positive attitudes towards e-cigs were statistically
significant predictors of e-cig use, which was consistent with findings from other studies
(Littlefield et al., 2015; Piñeiro et al., 2016; Pokhrel et al., 2016; Suftin et al., 2013), but the effect
sizes (Battitudes = .034, Bgender = .134) were small according to Cohen’s (1988) standards. Gender
accounted for more (about 13%) of the explanation for the variation in e-cig use. Knowledge was
not found to be a significant predictor of e-cig use. The insignificant role of knowledge in this
study’s findings may have occurred because students did not have accurate knowledge about the
dangers of e-cigs. False or unsubstantiated information which is currently rampant in media and
retail outlet advertisements about e-cigs can reduce risk perception among young adults (Choi &

17

Forster, 2013). Examining the influence of accurate knowledge of risks of e-cig use on the
intentions to smoke e-cigs remains an area for future educational intervention and further research.
Limitations
A number of limitations to this study should be noted. Data was obtained through selfreport and thus a social desirability bias may have impacted student report of use of e-cigs.
Students may have thought of e-cigs as unhealthy and therefore responded in ways that suggested
that they did not approve of or use them. In addition, this study was a cross-sectional one and
therefore cannot establish causal relationships. Also, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study,
there was no place for follow-up which could have provided more insight into the answers of the
respondents. Moreover most of the respondents were White non-Hispanic, and 18-year olds (the
youngest age group for this study), which limited the generalizability of findings by ethnicity and
age.
Conclusions
This study found a high rate of e-cig smoking among young adults (39%) compared to the
current national average (21%). Furthermore, more males than females smoked e-cigs, in line with
current literature. Positive attitudes were found to be significant predictors of e-cig smoking.
Further investigation could clarify which other factors nurture positive attitudes to e-cigs among
young adults. In addition, a large proportion of young adults (66%) indicated their intention to
smoke e-cigs within the next one month, possibly reflecting positive attitudes towards e-cigs. The
findings of this study showed areas of misinformation about e-cigs among young adult college
students and the predisposition of males to use e-cigs. Findings from this study can be used to
assist public health stakeholders to better understand the nature of e-cig use among young adult

18

college students. Public health researchers can utilize results of this study as a background
information for future investigations of e-cig use by young adult college students. Public health
practitioners can use information from this study to create interventions that may help to improve
the health of young adults. Interventions may be directed at educating college students about ecigs in order to cultivate accurate knowledge, and intervention programs may be targeted at male
young adults.

Study Two: The Influence of Internet Information on Young Adults’ Perceptions about
Electronic Cigarettes

37

Introduction
Since the commercialization of the internet in 1995, its role in the media has vastly
increased (Hilbert & Lopez, 2011). From carrying about one percent of information passing
through two-way communication in the 1990s, the internet progressed to capture about 51% of all
modern telecommunication in 2000 and more than 97% by 2007 (Hilbert & Lopez, 2011).
Worldwide internet usage also increased rapidly during this period, from 400 million users in 2000
to 3.2 billion in 2015 (International Telecommunication Union, 2016). This growth in internet
exposure was also mirrored in the United States (US) - about 84% of adults in the US had access
to the internet in 2015, up from about 9% in 1995 (Pew Research Center, 2016). Among the adult
population in the US, people aged 18-29 years reported the highest rate of internet use – 96% in
2015 (Pew Research Center, 2016).
The popularity and growth of the internet has made it a key platform for advertising and
marketing by businesses, including e-cig manufacturers and marketers. An analysis of online ecig marketing by Zhu et al. (2014) revealed that there were 466 e-cig brands in January 2014 and
each had its own website. E-cig advertising efforts through the internet also include the use of
social media. For instance, Huang, Kornfield, Szczypka, and Emery (2014) found that there were
73,672 tweets related to e-cigs between May 1 and June 30, 2012, about 90% of which were
commercial tweets which included links to websites that sell or promote e-cigs. Monitoring this
large interchange of information is daunting. Moreover, regulatory laws are difficult to enforce for
internet communications. Consequently, although cigarette advertisements were banned in the
United States in 1970, the internet is still being used to advertise and market cigarettes and other
tobacco products (Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids, 2015). Grana and Ling (2014) conducted an

38

analysis of e-cigarette retail websites to investigate advertising claims. They discovered that 95%
of the websites made explicit or implicit health-related claims, 64% had a smoking cessationrelated claim, 22% featured doctors, 76% claimed that the product did not produce secondhand
smoke, and 86% stated that the product could be smoked anywhere and evade clean air policies
(71%). Adolescents and young adults are likely to be targeted by advertisers. Grana and Ling
(2014) also reported that the advertising on the websites they reviewed was designed to attract
young people, by featuring actors with social status and other types of celebrities.
Furthermore, regular cigarette manufacturers have begun to invest in the e-cigarette
industry (Zhu et al., 2014). Blu eCigs, the largest producer and marketer of e-cigs in the United
States, was purchased by Lorillard, a large American tobacco company in 2013. Blu was later
purchased by another tobacco company (Imperial Tobacco Group) in 2014. Altria, the largest
tobacco company group in the US purchased Green Smoke, an e-cig company. Several regular
cigarette manufacturers have introduced their own lines of e-cigs; for example, RJ Reynolds,
which is a subsidiary of Reynolds American (the second largest tobacco company group in the
US), introduced the e-cig brand called VUSE. This investment by the tobacco industry has rapidly
transformed e-cig advertising messages, making them remarkably similar to pre-1970 regular
cigarette advertisements (McKee, 2013). This may be another attempt to popularize smoking
through the promotion of e-cig use.
Since young adults have the highest rate of internet exposure among the adult population
in the US (CDC, 2015), their potential for exposure to online e-cig information and subsequent
use of e-cigs is high. In fact, Legacy Foundation (2014) found that about 58% of young adults
between the ages of 18 and 21 years were exposed to e-cig advertisements on the internet while

39

Pokhrel, Fagan, Kehl, and Herzog (2015) also found that 59% of college students had seen e-cig
advertisements on the internet. Studies have linked exposure to e-cig advertisements to changes in
knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions. Sanders-Jackson et al. (2014) found a positive
relationship between exposure to e-cig advertisements and awareness and knowledge about e-cigs.
Pokhrel et al. (2016) discovered that exposure to e-cig advertisements resulted in attitudes that
were in favor of e-cigarettes. Villanti et al. (2015) found exposure to e-cig advertisements to be
associated with intentions to use e-cigs among young adults. Furthermore, Coleman et al. (2015)
discovered that approval or endorsement of e-cigs by family and peers is an important factor that
may affect how young adults process e-cig information. Thus, the influence of internet
advertisements may be partly responsible for the high rate of e-cig use among young adults
compared to other adult population groups (CDC, 2015).
The increasing use of e-cigs by young adults is a source of concern because a number of
public health risks are associated with their use. There is increasing evidence of nicotine poisoning
associated with e-cig use (CDC, 2014; Vakkalanka, Hardison, & Holstege, 2014). There is also
evidence of substances in e-cig smoke that can cause lung diseases and cancer (Allen et al., 2015;
Jensen et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2013). Furthermore, studies have shown that the use of ecigarettes is associated with regular cigarette use (Choi & Forster, 2014; Giovenco, Lewis, &
Delnevo, 2014; Littlefield, Gottlieb, Cohen, & Trotter, 2015) and may serve as a “gateway” to the
use of other psychoactive substances such as cocaine (Kandel, 1975; Kandel & Kandel, 2014). In
the context of these risks, it is important to understand how young adults engage with internet
information about e-cigs, and how it affects their perceptions about these devices and their
intention to smoke them.

40

Some theories of human behavior are applicable to explain the influence of internet
information on e-cig use among young adults. Two applicable theories are the Communications
Theory by Shannon and Weaver (1949) and the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory by Rogers
(1958, 2003). The Communication Theory and DOI both adopt a social approach to explain human
behavior.
Communications Theory is used to describe the process of communication, how it affects
people’s perceptions and interpretation of messages and how the process may influence human
behavior (Shannon & Weaver, 1949). The internet falls into the interactive form of communication,
one of the three forms described by the Communications Theory, the others being mass
communication/mass media such as radio or television and interpersonal communication. The
influence of communication on human behavior can be described using constructs highlighted in
Communications Theory, namely – sender (e-cig companies), message (e-cig information through
advertising and marketing strategies), medium or channel (various forms of internet-based
communication), receiver (young adults and other audiences) and feedback/reaction (behavior).
Some constructs of the DOI (Rogers, 1958, 2003) overlap with those in Communications
Theory. These constructs include the ideas of: innovation adoption (use of e-cigs) and how
communications impact the adoption of innovation. The communication channel of interest is the
internet. Examination of behavioral intentions to smoke allows the assessment of the construct of
time (which is used to describe adoption of the innovation). The effect of the innovation on the
social system can be captured by assessing the social use of e-cigs. Innovations in different social
systems, such as advertisements on the internet, should impact people’s intentions about
purchasing products (a key area assessed in this study). Thus, the focus on innovation adoption

41

may be considered roughly equivalent to the message construct of Communications Theory.
Moreover, demographics such as gender of participants, age and ethnic group can determine who
is likely to adopt the innovation. When examining key constructs in the aforementioned theories,
the current study had four aims:

1. To examine young adults exposure to internet advertising about e-cigs.
2. To assess the association between intentions to use e-cigs and exposure to advertising about
e-cigs.
3. To examine the relationship between exposure to internet advertising, demographic factors
(age and gender) and knowledge about e-cigs (with knowledge as the dependent variable).
4. To examine the relationship between exposure to internet advertising, demographic factors
(age and gender) and attitudes toward e-cig use (with attitudes as the dependent variable).
Methods
Participants
Participants in this study were the college students who participated in Study 1. The
approval from the university-based Institutional Review Board is presented in Appendix A.
Instrument
The same survey for Study 1 was used for analyses for this study (see Appendix B). As
mentioned, the survey was comprised of five sections – (1) Knowledge about e-cigs, (2) Attitudes
and beliefs concerning e-cigs, (3) E-cig and regular cigarette use, (4) Online e-cig information,

42

and (5) Demographic information. Section four, online e-cig information was a focus of analyses
for the current study. The questions used for analysis in this paper include:


Questions that assessed knowledge about e-cigs (questions 1-5 and question 7). The
responses were measured on a Likert scale (see Table 1 below).
Insert Table 1 here



Questions that assessed attitudes to e-cigs (questions 8 to 17). The responses to these
questions were also measured on a Likert scale (see Table 2 below).
Insert Table 2 here



Question 24 which assessed intention to use an e-cig within the next month (30 days). The
question text read as follows: “Do you think that you will try an e-cigarette within the next
one month?” and had 3 options: 1 – “I have already tried smoking e-cigarettes”, 2 – “Yes”,
3 – “No”.



Questions that assessed exposure of study participants to advertisements about e-cig
information on the internet (questions 27 and 30 presented in Table 3 below).
Insert Table 3 here



Questions that assessed demographic information about study participants (Questions 33
to 35, presented in Table 4 below).
Insert Table 4 here

43

Procedures
Procedures for this study were the same as those used in Study One. Professors from
different colleges at the university were contacted through e-mail and they provided permission to
recruit participants during their courses. The principal investigator went to the classrooms and
reviewed information about the study. Students were given an Information Sheet to review study
procedures, the voluntary nature of the study, and to provide contact information for the
investigator and representatives of the Institutional Review Board. Returning the survey indicated
a willingness to participate in the study. Surveys did not contain any identifying information. After
reviewing the Information Sheet (see Appendix C), participants completed the survey. Participants
were instructed not to put their names or any other identifying information on the survey.
A test-retest reliability study was performed by having 30 participants complete the survey
twice, one week apart. Prior to participating in this part of the study, students reviewed the
Information Sheet for the Test-Retest Study (Appendix D). The Information Sheet for the TestRetest Study provided contact information for the investigator and representatives from the
Institutional Review Board. The Information Form specified the voluntary nature of the study and
that returning the surveys would indicate study participation. In order to pair the pre-test and posttest surveys, students were instructed to write a number on their surveys that was the same for the
first and second administration of the surveys. No names or other identifying information were
written on the surveys.

44

Data Analysis
Data from the surveys were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) (Version 22.0). Bivariate correlations and Cohen’s kappa were used to examine test-retest
reliability data. Descriptive information about study participants were presented using frequencies
to describe categorical variables (sex and ethnic group). Frequencies were also used to describe
the extent of exposure of young adults to advertisements about e-cig information on the internet.
A chi-square analysis was used to examine the relationship between intentions to use ecigs in the next month (recoded into yes or no) and whether students had viewed advertisements
for e-cigs on the internet (recoded into yes or no).
A 2 X 2 X 4 (Gender X Ethnicity [“White Non-Hispanic” versus “Other Ethnic Groups”]
X Viewing E-Cig Advertisements) MANCOVA was conducted to examine the influence of
gender, ethnicity, and exposure to advertisements on the questions assessing knowledge about ecigs; age was the covariate. Viewing e-cig advertisement response categories were recoded into 4
categories: 0 = never used internet, never seen any advertisements, 1 = 1-5 times viewing e-cig
advertisements, 2 = 5-10 times; and 3 = more than 10 times. Gender was coded into 1 = Male, 2 =
Female. Ethnicity was coded into 2 = White non-Hispanic and 1 = other ethnic groups. Another (2
X 2 X 4) MANCOVA [with age as a covariate] was used to examine the influence of gender,
ethnicity, and exposure to internet advertisements on survey questions assessing attitudes.

45

Results
Reliability of Survey Items
Pearson’s correlations (r) and Cohen’s kappa (k) were used to assess the agreement
between responses for various survey questions. For example, Cohen’s kappa was used for the
question assessing whether participants had viewed e-cig advertisements to assess agreement, k =
.724, p < 0.001. Analysis also revealed statistically significant Pearson’s correlations (p < 0.05)
between test and retest responses for questions assessing knowledge and attitudes (Table 5).

Demographic Characteristics
A total of 420 college students aged 17 to 24 years of age completed the survey. Mean age
was about 20 years (SD = 1.59). About half (50.7%) were female (n = 213) and about 83% of the
respondents were White non-Hispanic (n = 351). Of the total sample of 320 college students, 44%
(n = 183) reported that they had seen an internet advertisement containing information about ecigs within the past 30 days.
Exposure to E-cig Information (by Gender, Age and Ethnicity)
Exposure of participants to internet advertisements about e-cigs is shown in Table 6. About
57% of participants who reported that they had viewed e-cig advertisements on the internet were
female (n = 105). The largest proportion of students who had seen e-cig advertisements on the
internet (24.6%) were aged 18 years (n = 44). About 79% of the students who had been exposed
to internet e-cig advertisements were white non-Hispanic (n = 143).

The Relationship between Intentions to Use E-cigs and Exposure to Internet Advertising
about E-cigs
A chi-square test of association was carried out to determine if there was a relationship
between exposure to internet advertising and intention to use e-cigs. Exposure to internet
advertising about e-cigs was not associated with intention to use e-cigs, Pearson chi-square =
1.162, p = .281.
The Influence of Demographic Characteristics (Gender, Age and Ethnicity) and Exposure
to E-cig Advertisements on Knowledge about E-cigs
Results from the MANCOVA (Gender X Ethnicity [“White Non-Hispanic” versus “Other
Ethnic Groups”] X Viewing E-Cig Advertisements) for the knowledge questions, with age as the
covariate revealed a statistically significant main effect for gender on knowledge about e-cigs,
Wilks’ Λ = .962, F (6, 381) = 2.476, p = .023, ηp2 = .038. Ethnicity and exposure to e-cig
advertisements were not statistically significant. Also, age was not statistically significant as the
covariate. The MANCOVA summary table is provided in Table 7. The results for univariate tests,
with means and standard deviations, for gender and questions assessing knowledge are presented
in Table 8. The univariate test for question 2 (knowledge about whether e-cigs contain the same
substances as regular cigarettes) was significant, F = 13.693, p < 0.001. On average, males more
strongly agreed that e-cigs do not contain the same substances as regular cigarettes, compared to
females.

The Influence of Demographic Characteristics (Gender, Age and Ethnicity) and Exposure
to E-cig Advertisements on Attitudes about E-cigs
Findings from the MANCOVA (Gender X Ethnicity [“White Non-Hispanic” versus “Other
Ethnic Groups”] X Viewing E-Cig Advertisements) for the attitudes questions, with Age as the
covariate showed a statistically significant main effect for gender, Wilks’ Λ = .926, F (10, 384) =
3.088, p = .001, ηp2 = .074. Age was significant as a covariate for this model, Wilks’ Λ = .942, F
(10, 384) = 2.363, p = .01, ηp2 = .058. Younger age was associated with more positive attitudes
towards e-cigs than older age. Ethnicity and exposure to e-cig advertisements were not statistically
significant. The MANCOVA summary table is provided in Table 9. The results for univariate tests,
with means and standard deviations, for gender and questions assessing attitudes are presented in
Table 10. Univariate tests for the following questions 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15 assessing gender
differences in attitudes were statistically significant (p < 0.05): question 8 (people should be
allowed to smoke e-cigs inside public buildings), 9 (e-cigs are less harmful to health than regular
cigarettes), 11 (e-cigs are safer than regular cigarettes), 14 (people of any age should be able to
use e-cigs) and 15 (e-cigs can be used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes). On average,
males had less negative views about people smoking inside public buildings compared to females.
Furthermore, males more strongly believed that e-cigs are less harmful to health than regular
cigarettes and that people of any age should be able to use e-cigs. Males more strongly believed
that e-cigs can be used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes. On average, males believed
that e-cigs are safer than regular cigarettes.

Discussion
This study examined the influence of internet information on young adults’ perceptions
about e-cigs. Results indicated that a sizeable proportion (44%) of young adults had seen at least
one advertisement on the internet about e-cigs, which indicated considerable exposure to e-cig
advertisements as found by other studies (Legacy Foundation, 2014; Pokhrel et al., 2015). This
finding shows that young adults are widely exposed to e-cig information through the internet.
Nevertheless, exposure to internet information about e-cigs was not significantly correlated with
intention to use e-cigs, suggesting that exposure to information about e-cigs through the internet
alone may not be sufficient to induce attitude or behavior change. There was a main effect for
gender on knowledge and attitudes about e-cigs – in general, males had a higher level of knowledge
about e-cigs and more positive attitudes towards them than females. Also, age was significant as a
covariate in the analysis of the effects of gender, ethnicity and exposure to e-cig advertisements
on the attitudes of young adults towards e-cigs. Younger age was associated with more favorable
attitudes towards e-cigs. These findings provide some evidence for gender-focused and agefocused interventions.
Exposure of Young Adults to Internet Advertising about E-cigs
Study results showed that about 44% of young adults were exposed to e-cig advertisements
on the internet. This rate is less than findings from other studies – Legacy (2014) found the rate of
exposure to be 58% while Pokhrel et al. (2015) found it to be 59%. Nevertheless, it shows that a
considerable number of young adults are viewing online e-cig advertisements, in line with current
literature. Of the young adults exposed to internet e-cig advertisements, about 57% were females.
Legacy (2014) found that e-cig exposure was similar across ethnicities. Most of the respondents

49

in the present study who reported exposure to online e-cig information were White non-Hispanics
(78%, n = 143) because they constituted a large proportion of the sample (83%, n = 351). The
proportions of respondents exposed to e-cig advertisements in each ethnic group were about 49%
for White non-Hispanics compared to 56% for other ethnicities.
Intention to Use E-cigs and Exposure to Advertising about E-cigs
This study showed no statistically significant association between intention to use e-cigs
and exposure to online e-cig information among young adults. This may also be explained by the
fact that other factors such as social influence (Coleman et al., 2015) and curiosity (Villanti et al.,
2015) can influence e-cig use. According to Coleman et al. (2015), approval or endorsement of ecigs by family and friends is an important influencing factor that may affect how young adults
process e-cig information. Villanti et al. (2016) found that curiosity mediated the relationship
between exposure to e-cig advertisements and e-cig use among young adults. The aforementioned
ideas are speculative and remain areas for future research.
Exposure to Internet Advertising, Demographic Factors and Knowledge about E-cigs
Contrary to the finding by Sanders-Jackson et al. (2014), showing there was a statistically
significant positive relationship between exposure to e-cig advertisements and knowledge about
e-cigs (knowledge increased with exposure), this study showed that there was no main effect for
exposure to e-cig advertisements on knowledge about e-cigs. This may be due to the fact that many
internet e-cig advertisements contain exaggerated or unsubstantiated information which do not
increase accurate knowledge about e-cigs, such as those that claim e-cigs may be used for smoking
cessation or those that claim they may be used for other health-related benefits (Grana & Ling,
2014). Nonetheless, this study found a main effect for gender on knowledge about e-cigs. On

50

average, males had a higher level of knowledge about e-cigs than females, but yet had more
positive attitudes towards e-cigs. This implies that males had the right ideas in their responses to
the questions, but their opinions were more favorable towards e-cigs than females. This finding
may suggest that the information about e-cigs to which young adults are exposed may be specially
modified to attract them to use e-cigs (Grana & Ling, 2014).
Exposure to Internet Advertising, Demographic Factors and Attitudes about E-cigs
This study revealed a main effect for gender on attitudes towards e-cigs. On average males
had more positive attitudes towards e-cigs than females. It may be, however, that males are more
positive about smoking in general, and a survey assessing attitudes towards other types of tobacco
use, along with attitudes toward e-cig use, may provide information to answer this question.
Nevertheless, there was no main effect for exposure to e-cigs on attitudes. This finding diverges
with that of Pokhrel et al. (2016) who discovered that e-cig advertisements may promote positive
attitudes towards e-cigs by portraying them as reduced-harm cigarette alternatives or ways to
enhance social life and self-image. E-cig advertisements on the internet may not be a main factor
affecting young adults’ attitudes because contemporary young adults tend to respond more to
messages passed through social media platforms such as Twitter than those seen on e-cig websites
(Huang et al., 2014). Age was a significant covariate in this analysis, suggesting that the effect of
e-cig advertisement exposure on young adults’ attitudes towards e-cigs varies by age. Further
investigation is needed to determine the role of age on the attitudes on young adults.

51

Limitations
This study had a number of limitations. Data was obtained through self-reported surveys
which may diminish the reliability of findings. In addition, participants could have responded in
socially desirable ways due to the fact that they completed the surveys in their classrooms in the
presence of their peers. They may also have responded in socially desirable ways because they
perceive e-cigs as unhealthy and do not want to be publicly associated with them. Moreover, crosssectional studies cannot be used to establish causal relationships. Furthermore, the effect sizes for
the results were small according to Cohen’s (1988) standards and this may limit the
generalizability of findings. Finally, most of the respondents (83%) were White non-Hispanic, and
18-year olds who represent the lowest age of participants also formed the largest age group (28%)
of the sample. Results may have been different if more young adults of color and young adults in
a broader age range participated. Moreover, participants were enrolled in a college setting, and
assessment of attitudes of adults in other settings may have yielded different results.
Conclusions
This study provides limited evidence for the effect of internet e-cig advertisements on the
perceptions of young adults, mainly through knowledge change. Nonetheless, the survey used for
this study did not directly evaluate the types of knowledge being shared in internet advertisements.
It may be that the information in these advertisements indirectly changes the image projected by
e-cigs, making them appear harmless or even beneficial. However, further research will be needed
to explore this idea. If this idea is correct, then there may be a need for regulations to ensure that
e-cig advertisements present accurate information about the health risks associated with smoking
e-cigs. Perhaps qualitative studies assessing the content of advertisements on the internet and other

52

types of social media, and how college students interpret this information is an area for future
research. In general, males may have more positive attitudes than females, suggesting the need to
direct extra educational efforts towards males. Hence, study results contributed to existing
knowledge about the influence of internet information on young adult e-cig perceptions and
highlight the need for further research to increase understanding of the relationship between
exposure to e-cig information on the internet and young adults’ e-cig perceptions.
