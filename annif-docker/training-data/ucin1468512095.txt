Abstract
Gamification, or adding game like elements to non-game activities, has been used widely in a
variety of industries to motivate people and is a strategy that educators are now using to motivate
students in coursework. Previous research on gamification applied to educational settings is
limited, and most of the available literature on gamification that claim benefits are either
hypothesized or experienced-based without empirical research to substantiate it (Kim, 2015c).
Outcomes from gamification studies have been varied, and this is likely due to the fact that few
of the education-related studies isolated any specific gamification component, but instead
lumped various components together to evaluate the effect making it difficult to determine which
gamification components may be beneficial to student achievement and/or motivation and which
may be detrimental. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to contribute to the existing
body of literature and answer four specific questions about gamification components: how do the
specific gamification components of unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking affect student
achievement; is there a significant difference in achievement in extrinsically motivated students
versus intrinsically motivated students in a gamified online course; what are student perceptions
of the gamified components of unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking in an online course;
and how do student perceptions of a gamified course correlate with data regarding student
achievement. Of the three gamification components evaluated, unlimited lives was the only one
that did not show any negative effects in terms of student achievement measured. In the badges
course section, achievement was lowest for the assignments that had badges connected to them,
while assignments that did not have badges connected were often at a higher level of
achievement compared to other sections. Badges may, in fact, have negative effects on student
achievement and more research should follow to further investigate. The level-locking section
ii

had the highest grades for assignments that were part of the level-locking component, but this did
not transfer over to assignments that required higher-order thinking. In fact, students in this
section had the lowest scores on the higher order thinking assignments. Motivation orientation at
the beginning of a course did not have a significant difference on student achievement between
the gamified sections. Overall students had mostly positive views of the gamification
components, though the students in the badging section were more likely than others to rate the
gamification component as negative. Students perceived that the gamification components
helped them learn the content and most thought other courses should offer these types of
components. Although student perceptions of the gamified components were mostly positive,
these perceptions do not always support the actual achievement data in the course.
Keywords: gamification, gamified course, badges, content unlocking, freedom to fail

The journey of completing this dissertation has been both challenging and enlightening. It
was extremely difficult for me to narrow down a topic and choose something for which I would
remain passionate throughout the dissertation. I found it extremely difficult to balance my work
life, personal life, and my life as a doctoral student. While I would like to say that I somehow
overcame these obstacles through some process, the reality is that my looming 9 year deadline
and the constant pushing of my advisor and friends helped me in achieving my goal. I can say
that through this process I learned a tremendous amount about priorities and time management.
I would like to first and foremost thank my chair, Dr. Vicki Carr for her belief in my
ability to accomplish this from the first time she met me. It is your undying belief in me and your
ability to continually challenge me to reach new levels that continues to motivate me to move
forward in my professional life. Thank you for hiring me for my first teaching job twelve years
ago, for being an amazing mentor through the years, and for all of your help in this dissertation
process. I would also like to thank Dr. Cathy Maltbie for being so extremely patient with me as I
ran every statistical test 14 times in your office. Your faith, encouragement, and patience are
incredible, and I can’t thank you enough. You are a great teacher. To Dr. Mary Boat, I would
like to thank you for being encouraging every time I stuck my head in your office door
unexpectedly. Thank you for providing me with an outlet to explore my technological talents and
giving me a passion for getting this dissertation complete. You are a great leader, and I have
learned much from you.
There are so many other people that have helped me on this journey. Thank you to Laura
Dell for allowing me the flexibility to work on my dissertation when my brain power was at its
peak. Your viewpoints on people and how they learn is always refreshing and inspiring. Thanks

to my wonderful Tri-Life family and friends, and especially to Maureen and Aldo. You have
shown me my own inner strength, helped me find my voice, and encouraged me like no other. I
will be forever grateful to you and the Tri-Life staff for helping me along my journey of personal
growth. You are amazing people, and I truly consider each and every one of you family. Thank
you to Allie and Cody for always helping me out and supporting me when things got
overwhelming. At least you can both say that you learned some very useful skills during our time
at home together. You are both amazing, and I am so very proud of both of you. If I had the
chance to pick, I would choose both of you every time. Never stop learning, no matter what form
that learning takes. Thanks to my art buddies, Sue, Sarah, and Angela for being role models,
providing me with an outlet for creative expression, and always encouraging me to persevere
through both your words and your examples. Thanks to all of my friends in the field and the
entire faculty in the School of Education at UC for always supporting me and cheering me on.
And lastly, thanks to my parents, Karen Sand and Russ Cox for instilling the importance of
education in me at a young age. Growing up I believed that college was not just an option, it was
a necessity. Thank you for supporting me and pushing me to succeed even when I didn’t think I
had it in me. I can finally say that I’ve finished this epic journey to acquire the title of Doctor and
can start the next chapter of my life.

Gamification in an Online Course:
Promoting Student Achievement through Game-Like Elements
Background of the Study
Online education in the United States continues to grow as institutions of higher
education offer both more online programs and more online courses, and teacher education is no
exception (Robinson & Latchem, 2003). The growth rate of overall enrollments in the higher
education student body in the United States in 2013 exceeded 20 million students, an increase of
1.2% from the previous year, but of that 1.2% almost three-fourths of those students were
distance students (Allen & Seaman, 2015). Over 70% of chief academic leaders declare that
online learning is vital for their long-term strategy, rising from 48.8% in 2002 and making this
the largest percentage seen yet (Allen & Seaman, 2015). This is likely due to the many benefits
afforded to students taking online courses including access to college for students living in rural
areas and students who have additional full-time responsibilities such as work or family (Allen &
Seaman, 2015; Blackmon, 2013; Kurzman, 2013; Reeves & Reeves, 2008; Rumble & Latchem,
2004). Most academic leaders (74.1%) rate the learning outcomes of online courses as equivalent
or better than those of face-to-face courses (Allen & Seaman, 2015).
This popularity of online education also constitutes concerns. It was originally thought by
many that online courses would be more efficient and cost-effective, but that has not completely
been proven true since reports suggest more time and effort of faculty members are expended for
online courses (Allen & Seaman, 2015). Additionally, retention of students in online courses
continues to be a concern for academic leaders, with the majority of academic leaders (68.3%)
reporting that “students need more discipline to succeed in an online course than in a face-to-face
course” (Allen & Seaman, 2015, pg. 23). Students report they can easily become disengaged and

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
disconnected in online courses due to factors such as the pace of instruction or not understanding
the materials being presented (Tao, 2008 as cited in Gunter & Kenny, 2014). In fact, the dropout
rates of students in online courses are significantly higher than in face-to-face courses (Clay,
Rowland, & Packard, 2009). This results in frustration and lower levels of confidence for
students (Poellhuber, Chomienne & Karsenti, 2008). Studies suggest that student motivation
levels at the beginning of a course can be a strong predictor of course completion and success
(Baynton, 1992; Gunter & Kenny, 2014).
Motivation in Educational Settings.
Motivation is a theoretical concept that is used to explain behavior, particularly goaldirected behavior. Maehr & Meyer (1997) describe motivation as a personal investment of the
resources that an individual brings to a task, such as time, knowledge, energy, skills, and
dispositions, such as persistence or intensity. When, in what circumstances, and how individuals
use those resources to accomplish a task results in a range of motivation from intrinsic to
extrinsic. In classroom situations, motivation is used to explain the behaviors, such as attention
and effort, which help or interfere with achieving learning outcomes (Brophy, 2004).
Motivation is an interplay of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In other words, when a person
takes action to perform a goal-oriented behavior, the action may be either self-determined, or
intrinsically motivated, or controlled by outside factors, or extrinsically motivated. While it is
common to discuss motivation in terms of being either intrinsically motivated or extrinsically
motivated, this is quite an oversimplification of the construct. Rather, in most situations,
motivation resides within a range from being not motivated at all to being motivated only by
outside components to being motivated by internal interest and enjoyment. In many cases,
behavior is motivated by both intrinsic and extrinsic means.
2

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Motivation has been identified as a key component to success in online courses (Bekele,
2010; Jones & Issroff, 2007; Muilenburg & Berge, 2005), though there is relatively little
research available on how instructors or course structure may enhance motivation in online
contexts (Fritea & Opre, 2015). Motivation can be defined as “the process whereby goal-directed
activity is instigated and sustained” (Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008, p. 4). Motivation is
important in any type of learning as it influences what we learn, how we learn, and when we
choose to learn (Schunk, 1995). Motivated students are more likely to be actively engaged in
learning activities and to display enhanced performance and persistence (Schunk, Pintrich, &
Meece, 2008). Students become motivated to learn when they have a belief that the content and
tasks within a course are within their zone of proximal development (Fritea & Opre, 2015;
Vygotsky, 1978). Therefore, an important task in trying to motivate students is instilling the right
amount of confidence (Pajares, 1996).
Gamification as a Tool to Motivate.
In an effort to motivate students and instill that “right amount of confidence,” educators
have begun to “gamify” their courses. The term “gamification” became prevalent in literature in
2010 (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011). Gamification involves taking the elements
that make games fun and motivating and using them in non-game contexts (Deterding, Dixon,
Khaled, & Nacke, 2011; Kapp, 2012). Gamification encompasses adding a layer to an existing
activity to change the user’s experience with that activity.
The 2013 State of Online Gaming Report (NewZoo, 2013) predicted that by the end of
2013, more than 1.2 billion people would play games on computers, tablets, or smartphones.
This rapid increase in the use of smart phones allowing the World Wide Web to be accessed

3

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
mobily along with the increased use of social media have set the stage for gamification to capture
attention and change behavior (Kim, 2015a).
Gamification has been used widely in many industries to motivate people to use products
or services or engage in healthier activities. One well-known example of gamification made
headlines in 2009 with Volkswagen’s “Fun Theory Initiative” which was “dedicated to the
thought that something as simple as fun is the easiest way to change people’s behavior for the
better” (Volkswagen, 2009). Engineers changed the traditional staircase at the Odenplan train
station into a musical staircase, resulting in 66% more people taking the stairs rather than taking
the neighboring escalator. In the same year, Foursquare introduced a social networking app that
awarded badges, points, and mayor status to players who “checked in” at various locations
(Rimon, 2014). In 2010, Fortune Magazine stated that companies and organizations were
beginning to realize they could use the same strategies that generate and sustain interest in games
to generate business or change behaviors, citing the Race to the Top grant program from the US
Department of Education as just one example of a gamified approach (Mangalindan, 2010).
Since then, numerous fitness apps, such as Fitbit and Garmin’s Vivofit, have been designed to
engage players in challenges, awarding badges and trophies to increase motivation.
As promising as gamification sounds, it is not without critics (Bogost, 2011a; Bogost,
2011b; Rughinis, 2013; (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 2001). Opponents of gamification claim that
the extrinsic rewards provided by gamification undermine the intrinsic motivation of students
(Deci et al., 2001) Proponents of gamification assert that these negative effects can be nullified if
the gamification techniques support the components of autonomy, competence, and relatedness
spelled out in Deci & Ryan’s Self-Determination theory (Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan,
1991). In other words, when the gamification component enhances or supports students in
4

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
feeling a sense of control over their learning or a choice in how or what they are learning, when
they feel successful in learning the content, and when they feel connected to others in the
classroom, then the gamification component is less likely to harm intrinsic motivation.
Conceptual Underpinnings for the Study
The conceptual underpinnings that framed this study were the ARCS motivation model
(Keller, 1987; Keller, 1984) and self-determination theory (Deci et al., 1991). Initial design of
the course within the learning management system took the ARCS motivation model into
account. The ARCS motivation model and self-determination theory informed the selection of
the gamification components.
Arcs motivation model. Keller (1984) performed an extensive review of motivational
literature and developed the ARCS motivation model after discovering that the motivational
concepts in the literature could be clustered around four categories: attention, relevance,
confidence, and satisfaction. These categories provide the basis for instructional design of
educational classes, and can influence the degree of effort that a student puts forth. Keller
defined attention as capturing interest or stimulating curiosity, and suggested that instructors
should ask themselves how they can make a learning experience more interesting to students.
Relevance is defined as being able to meet each learner’s personal needs or goals to promote a
positive attitude about the learning, or in other words, how is the learning experience valuable to
the student? Confidence is defined as assisting students to have a belief that they can be
successful and control their success, and satisfaction is defined as reinforcing student
accomplishments with either internal or external rewards to help students feel good about the
experience and want to learn more.

Self-determination theory. While there is a dearth of research specifically exploring
motivation in online contexts, self-determination theory (Deci et al., 1991) provides perhaps one
of the most accepted views of motivation in the context of educational settings. Selfdetermination theory (Deci et al., 1991) in educational settings posits that intentional behaviors
vary along a continuum of being self-determined as opposed to being controlled. Behaviors are
considered self-determined when they are chosen freely due to one’s own volition. Behaviors
that are chosen due to some form of outside pressure or stimulus are considered controlled.
Intrinsically motivated behaviors are naturally self-determined. Extrinsically motivated
behaviors can become self-determined through the processes of internalization, or adopting
external regulations internally, and integration, or assimilating the new regulations into one’s
being (Deci, 1994). Focusing on three innate psychological needs of autonomy (free-choice or
free-will), competence (the degree of self-efficacy or the degree to which one feels successful),
and relatedness (feeling connected to others), self-determination theory specifies that satisfying
any of these needs contributes to motivation. In addition, the degree to which the components of
autonomy, competence, and relatedness are apparent in an activity impact whether the activity is
more intrinsically or extrinsically motivating for the student.
Statement of the Problem
The research on gamification in educational settings is rather limited, and most of the
available literature on gamification that claim benefits are either hypothesized or experiencedbased without empirical research to substantiate it (Kim, 2015c). Hamari, Koivisto, & Sarsa
(2014) completed a literature review of peer-reviewed empirical studies on gamification related
to motivational affordances (not necessarily in educational settings) which resulted in 24 studies.
A systematic mapping of research on gamification techniques that have been applied to
6

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
education resulted in only 26 articles meeting the criteria of being a primary study (not
necessarily peer-reviewed empirical studies), related to education, written in English, and using
the keyword gamification prior to March of 2013 (Borges, Durelli, Reis, & Isotani, 2014). This
indicates that gamification in education is a relatively new topic in research with much
opportunity for this study to contribute to the research base.
Outcomes from gamification studies have been varied. Overall, student perception of the
gamified courses is positive, with the exception of leader boards which seem only to be positive
in very competitive programs of study (Barata, Gama, Jorge, & Goncalves, 2013). Regarding
student performance, some studies suggest no significant difference or mixed results between
control groups and gamified groups (Leaning, 2015; de-Marcos, Domínguez, Saenz-deNavarrete, & Pages, 2014) while others show improvement in performance in the gamified group
(Charles, Bustard, & Black, 2011; Sheth, Bell, & Kaiser, 2012 as cited in Leaning, 2015).
Studies that focus on motivation and engagement in gamified courses report that students feel
more engaged and participated more (Charles, Bustard, & Black, 2011; Cronk, 2012; Denny,
2013; Leaning, 2015; Paisley 2013). In the review of empirical studies on gamification and
motivation by Hamari et al. (2014), only 2 of the studies reported completely positive effects.
While several studies have incorporated badges (Denny, 2013; Hanus & Fox, 2015). Deci,
Koestner, & Ryan (2001) warn against the potential negative impact that badges and other types
of gamification may have on intrinsic motivation. In their meta-analysis of studies around
extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation, examination suggests that performance-contingent
rewards may have the most undermining effect on intrinsic motivation, with performancecontingent rewards defined as those rewards that are given for exceptional performance on a task
or performance that measures up to a specific standard (Deci et al., 2001). However, in the same
7

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
analysis, Deci and colleagues performed a supplemental analysis in which they suggest that
rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation for tasks that are dull, since there is little intrinsic
motivation related to such a task.
Investigation of the education-related articles related to gamification reveals that few of
the studies isolated any specific gamification component, but rather lumped various components
together to evaluate the effect, often with mixed results. This creates difficulty in determining
which gamification components may be beneficial to student achievement and/or motivation and
which may be detrimental.
Purpose of the Study
Gamification has been used in education settings in increasing rates, but the results of
studies on gamification in education have been mixed, with some studies claiming gamification
works and is beneficial to student achievement and others stating it is not. One limitation with
previous studies has been that gamification techniques have been applied in clumps rather than
compared across groups. While this may enhance any effect of the gamification component, it
also makes it very difficult to determine which components are actually responsible for the
changes. Since different studies have incorporated various combinations of gamification
components, this may account for some of the mixed results in studies. In addition, it is often
difficult to determine whether the studies were conducted in fully face-to-face courses, blended
courses, or online courses, though it appears that the majority of studies are in either face-to-face
or blended courses. This research study sought to contribute to the small body of literature
available on gamification in online settings, and specifically investigated how individual
gamification components influence student achievement in an online course.

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
The purpose of this research study was to evaluate three specific gamification
components in isolation to determine which, if any, of those components affected student
achievement in an online course. In addition, the study sought to determine if there were
significant differences in achievement associated with student’s motivation level at the beginning
of the course across the different gamification components. Lastly, this study reviewed student
perceptions of the gamified course. Specifically, the purpose of this mixed-methods study was to
investigate the following research questions:
1. How do the specific gamification components of unlimited lives, badging, and levellocking affect student achievement?
2. Is there a significant difference in achievement in extrinsically motivated students
versus intrinsically motivated students in a gamified online course?
3. What are student perceptions of the gamified components of unlimited lives, badging,
and level-locking in an online course?
4. How do student perceptions of a gamified course correlate with data regarding
student achievement?
Definitions of Key Terms
Badges: A virtual icon awarded to students based on quiz performance. The introductory
Child Development course was 14 weeks in length and was arranged in 14 weekly modules.
Seven (7) of the modules contained a quiz (Modules 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 13). Since there were
seven quizzes in the course, students had seven opportunities to earn badges. Badges had names
that related to the course content, and included: Master of the Historical Views of Development,
Guru of Nature vs. Nurture, Sensei of Prenatal Development and Birth, Ruler of Brain
Development, Chief of Physical and Motor Development, Commander of Cognitive
9

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Development, and Champion of Social Emotional Development. Badges were awarded to
students upon earning a score of 80% or above on the quizzes in the online course. Students had
unlimited attempts on said quizzes to earn the badge, and could go back at any point in time in
the course to retake the quiz to earn the badge. If students earned all seven badges, they also
earned an eighth badge titled “Admiral of Child Development” which allowed them to print a
certificate of achievement for the course. The purpose of the badge was to motivate students to
want to earn at least 80% on the quizzes in hopes that this would reinforce their knowledge of
course content. Individual students could see their own badges on a page titled “My
Achievements” in the Blackboard course site. In compliance with FERPA regulations, students
could not see the badges that other students may have earned. In the announcement for the week
following a quiz, the instructor posted the number of students who had earned the badge.
Extrinsic Motivation: Extrinsic motivation is the type of motivation that occurs as a result
of an external process, such as a reward or benefit. The primary cause of the motivation is
external to the individual rather than driven by values, beliefs, or goals.
Gamification: Gamification refers to enhancing a course with game-like elements to
motivate and engage students. The Introductory Child Development course used gamification by
applying the game-like elements of badges, unlimited lives, and level-locking to the course.
Intrinsic Motivation: Intrinsic motivation is the type of motivation that occurs as a result
of internally held beliefs, values, or goals or for its interest or enjoyment. It is the result of
internal influences rather than external influences.
Level-locking: Level-locking means that students cannot reach later (or higher) levels of
course content until they “unlock it” by achieving the required criteria on a quiz. The
Introductory Child Development course was 14 weeks in length and was arranged in 14 weekly
10

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
modules. Seven (7) of the modules contained a quiz (Modules 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 13). Upon
the start of the course, only the first module was available to students. All other modules were
hidden with an adaptive release function of the learning management system. Students could
“unlock” the next module by scoring at least 80% on the quiz for the current module. Students
had unlimited attempts on the quiz to unlock the module.
Online Course: An online course in this study is defined as an asynchronous, distance
learning course in which there are no in-person meetings and no synchronous activities. All
content resides within the learning management system of the course.
Unlimited Lives: Students had unlimited attempts to take a quiz or turn in an assignment.
Only the highest grade applied to the calculation of course grades. Students could repeat an
assignment or quiz as many times as they wished until they achieved their desired score.
Motivation: Defined by Ryan and Deci (2000) as being “moved to do something” (p. 54).
Motivation in this study is viewed in terms of a scale of intrinsic to extrinsic motivation, with the
understanding that students display components of both types of motivation and are not simply
either intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. In terms of what students are “moved to do,” in
this course, motivation is defined as being moved to earn a higher grade on each assignment.
Self-Determination: Self-determination is defined by Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, and Ryan
(1991) as a theory of motivation that distinguishes between behaviors that are self-determined,
defined as engaged in by choice and supported by one’s internal desires and interests, and those
that are controlled by either an interpersonal or external regulation. While self-determination is
not specifically measured as a construct in this study, the theory does provide a framework for
thinking about motivation and course design.

11

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Student Achievement: For the purposes of this study, student achievement was defined as
grades on assignments within the course, which included quizzes (7), final exam (1), written
homework assignments (9), written major papers (3), and final course grade.
Assumptions, Limitations, and Design Controls
Assumptions. It is assumed that students were truthful in their responses to perceptions
of the online course. The score on assignments for earning badges and unlocking content was set
at 80% because this represents the lowest score a student can earn and still obtain a B. It was
assumed that a score of at least a B would constitute satisfactory student achievement and
understanding of the content. It is also assumed that all of the sections had equivalent instruction,
communication, and grading practices. In addition, it is assumed that any differences in student
achievement between the sections is due to the differences in gamification rather than due to
other, unrelated factors.
Limitations. Limitations of this study include the population of students in the study.
This study looked specifically at undergraduate students in a completely online Child
Development course in a Midwestern university. Therefore, results may not be generalizable to
blended or face-to-face courses, graduate courses, or courses in other disciplines. In addition,
students generally took this course in their freshman or sophomore year of a program, therefore
results may not be generalizable for courses taking place later within a program’s curriculum.
Student perception data was collected in the form of a final course reflection and end-ofcourse survey. While the end of course survey was anonymous, the final course reflection was
submitted as part of the course work. Therefore, opinions given as part of the final course
reflection may have been influenced by the fact that the instructor would see the answers prior to
assigning a grade for the course.
12

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
The current study lacks a control group. Student enrollments for the course resulted in
only enough students to populate three sections of the course. The researcher chose to compare
the three gamification components to one another rather than have a control group and two
gamification conditions. In addition, university regulations regarding teaching load for
instructors prohibited the same instructor from teaching all three sections during the same
semester. One instructor taught two sections, and a second instructor taught the third section.
While every attempt was made to ensure that the sections were taught exactly the same,
individual differences between the instructors may have influenced the results.
Motivation data was collected only at the beginning of the course. The purpose in
collecting this data was to determine if motivation level at the beginning of the course had any
influence on the achievement levels in the various gamification conditions. The researcher chose
not to collect motivation data at the end of the course to compare how the gamification condition
may have influenced motivation because it was outside the realm of this specific study.
Summary
Chapter one presented the background, conceptual framework, and purpose of this study.
Online university teacher education is becoming more prevalent in the United States, presenting
both opportunities and challenges for students. Instructors must address the challenges,
specifically motivation and engagement as these are critical factors for success in college
coursework since poor motivation is a critical factor in high drop-out rates in online courses
(Muilenburg & Berge, 2005). Gamification components are becoming increasingly common in
college courses in an attempt to remedy these engagement and motivation issues. The research
on gamification, particularly in online courses, is scarce. In the research that does exist, results
on the value and effect on student learning are conflicting. This may be due to the fact that
13

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
gamification components have not been studied as individual variables, but rather have been
lumped together in in a package of gamification components that varies by study (Barata, Gama,
Jorge, & Goncalves, 2013; Hanus & Fox, 2015; Leaning, 2015). This research purposed to
evaluate three different gamification components in isolation to determine how those
components affected student achievement in an online course, to determine if there were
significant differences in achievement in terms of motivation level at the beginning of the course
across the different gamification components, and finally to examine student perceptions of the
experience.
Chapter two contains a review of the existing literature on gamification in educational
settings and gamification related to motivational affordances within the contextual framework of
self-determination theory. Chapter three presents the methodology used, details of the
participants, and details of the gamified course. Chapter four provides the results of the study.
Quantitative results for the first two research questions are presented first, followed by the
quantitative and qualitative results for question three. The chapter ends with a discussion of how
the two different sets of data compare to one another (question four). Chapter five discusses and
summarizes the results and effectiveness of the gamification components and includes directions
for future research.
CHAPTER 2
Review of Related Literature
As programs in higher education continue to offer both more online programs and more
online courses, it becomes clear that online learning is a fundamental long-term strategy for
colleges (Allen & Seaman, 2015; Robinson & Latchem, 2003). While online education is
attractive to students because of the flexibility and accessibility, these same components can
14

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
make it particularly difficult for students to have positive experiences in courses and maintain the
high level of self-motivation, self-discipline, and self-direction that is required for success
(Borup, West, & Graham, 2011; Lee & Choi, 2010; Moore, 1997; Rabe-Hemp, Woolen, &
Humiston, 2009). The most common hurdles that face students in online courses include poor
participation, procrastination, and feelings of isolation (Rabe-Hemp et al., 2009), which may be
contributing factors to the higher student dropout rate than those found in traditional courses
(Clay, Rowland, & Packard, 2009; Kop, 2011; Lee & Choi, 2010). Students who participate
actively in a course are more likely to complete online courses, and studies suggest that student
motivation levels at the beginning of a course can be a strong predictor of course completion and
success (Baynton, 1992; Gunter & Kenny, 2014; Lee & Choi, 2010).
Motivation
Motivation can be described as the initiation, investment, and sustainment of personal
resources in goal-directed behavior (Maehr & Meyer, 1997; Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008).
Personal resources could include assets such as time, knowledge, energy, skills, or dispositions
such as attention, persistence, or intensity. Research suggests that motivation is important in
learning since it influences what we learn, how we learn, and when we choose to learn, and that
motivated students are more likely to be actively engaged in learning activities and to display
enhanced performance and persistence (Schunk, 1995; Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008).
Motivation runs along a continuum ranging from amotivation (not being motivated at all)
to purely extrinsic motivation (being motivated by outside influences) to purely intrinsic
motivation (being motivated by interest or enjoyment) (Ryan & Deci, 2000). In most cases,
motivation is a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. For example, a person may
love his job and perform excellently based on internal enjoyment and the desire to perform well.
15

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
It might seem that this is an example of purely intrinsic motivation; however, it is unlikely that
said individual would continue to perform the job without the extrinsic reward of a paycheck.
This showcases the interplay of the factors that are often at work in most situations.
Several theories exist regarding motivation, including behavior reinforcement theories,
need theories, goal theories, intrinsic motivation theories, and flow. Behavior reinforcement
theories represent earlier views of motivation in which individuals were viewed as passive
beings that responded to basic drives, needs, and reinforcements (Brophy, 2004). Need theories
provided an expanded view of traditional behavior reinforcement theories by focusing on the
responses to behaviors as a result of internal needs and desires rather than external incentives,
though they are highly criticized for the circular logic they employ (Brophy, 2004). Maslow’s
Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow, 1962) is perhaps the most widely known example of a need theory
of motivation. Goal theories have attempted to go beyond the reactive view of behavior
reinforcement and need theories and add a cognitive component to explain why a person chooses
to do something. Martin Ford (1992) has perhaps the best known goal theory in which 24 goals
are grouped into the six categories of affective goals, cognitive goals, subjective organization
goals, self-assertive social relationship goals, integrative social relationship goals, and task goals.
Intrinsic motivation theories focus more on the individual choosing what he or she would like to
pursue rather than relying on what he or she needs to do. Deci and Ryan’s (1985) SelfDetermination Theory is the most prominent example of an intrinsic motivation theory. Flow is a
term coined by Mihaly Csiksentmihalyi (1993) to explain the characteristics that lead to an
activity becoming so enjoyable that a person loses himself in the activity because he has become
so absorbed. As with any construct, motivation is likely an interplay of many different factors,
and all of the theories provide insight into the construct.
16

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Motivation in Educational Settings
Traditional school systems rely heavily on behavior reinforcement theories of motivation
through the use of grades, report cards, and other types of awards (Brophy, 2004). The
expectancy-value model of motivation is a helpful tool in exploring motivation (Wigfield &
Eccles, 2000). This model posits that effort is based on two components: the perceived
competence of the individual in the given task, and the amount that the individual values the
rewards the task brings or the opportunity to engage in the task itself. Hansen (1989) provides
four approaches that students generally take regarding educational tasks: engaging with the task
occurs because they see value and feel competent; dissembling occurs when they see value in the
task but lack confidence; students evade the task when they feel confidence but see little value in
the task; rejecting occurs when students lack confidence and see little value in the task. The key,
therefore, in classrooms is to help students feel both confident and see value or use in the tasks
they are performing.
Motivation is a certainly a key component to success in online courses (Bekele, 2010;
Jones & Issroff, 2007; Muilenburg & Berge, 2005), though relatively little is known about how
to enhance motivation in online contexts (Fritea & Opre, 2015). Self-determination theory, an
intrinsic motivation theory, provides one of the most accepted views of motivation in relation to
educational settings (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Deci et al., 1991).
Self-Determination Theory
Self-determination theory is a theory of motivation that attempts to explain educational
motivation in terms of student interest in learning, the value of education, and confidence in
one’s capacities and abilities. The theory relies heavily on a concept called perceived locus of
causality, which is the extent to which one’s actions are engaged in voluntarily and of one’s own
17

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
volition or to the extent that the actions are being controlled by something or someone outside of
the person (Deci & Ryan, 1985). Self-determination theory differs from other theories of
motivation by attempting to go beyond the processes that direct behavior and look deeper into
why an individual desires those behaviors. To do this, the theory takes into account three innate
human needs: competence, relatedness, and autonomy. Central components in the category of
competence are the sense of “having control over outcomes (Crandall, Katkovsky, & Crandall,
1965), being self-efficacious (Bandura, 1977), having confidence (Dweck, 1986), and having the
strategies and capacities for success (Skinner, Wellborn, & Connell, 1990)” (Dei & Ryan, 1985,
p. 339). The concept of relatedness concerns the sense of connection that an individual feels to
others. This includes having a sense of belonging, feeling respected, and feeling cared for by a
teacher (Ryan and Deci, 2000). A sense of autonomy revolves around the perceived locus of
causality, or where the drive for the behavior is coming from, be it internal sources or external
sources which, in part, refer to whether an individual believes that he/she can control the
outcomes, or whether the outcomes are dependent upon the behavior (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
Self-determination theory contains six mini-theories, each of which describes a specific
facet of motivation or personality. Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) is a theory about intrinsic
motivation and the effects of social situations, such as rewards or interpersonal controls, on
intrinsic motivation and is especially concerned with the role that competence and autonomy
have in supporting intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is addressed by Organismic
Integration Theory (OIT). This theory is concerned with how various subtypes of extrinsic
motivation fall on a continuum of internalization as well as the various social situations that
influence internalization. Other theories that are less related to the current study include
Causality Orientations Theory (COT) which discusses how individual differences in orientation
18

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
result in various types of regulation on behavior. The Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT)
focuses on the three essential needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence and how these
psychological needs relate to health and well-being. Goal Contents Theory (GCT) looks at the
differences between intrinsic and extrinsic goals and how they influence motivation and wellness,
and Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT) focuses on relationships and interactions that
support autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
Instructors who focus on implementing activities that support or increase the feelings of
autonomy, competence, and relatedness in students will find that students are more intrinsically
motivated. Providing choices to increase autonomy, offering optimally challenging tasks to
increase competence, and building strong relationships with students to build relatedness are all
factors in increasing intrinsic motivation. Verbal praise has an enhancing effect on intrinsic
motivation for adults, but for children the effect can be negative (Deci et. al., 2001). Extrinsic
rewards are typically seen as a negative influence on motivation because they do not support
feelings of autonomy. However, if the extrinsic rewards are given for boring tasks for which the
student must engage anyway and for which most students do not find intrinsic interest in, there
may be no harm to intrinsic motivation (Deci et al., 2001). Therefore, self-determination theory
suggests that instructors must determine how to encourage feelings of competence and autonomy
in an effort to internalize the intrinsic motivation. Promoting autonomy, relatedness, and
competence from a distance can be a challenge in online courses. Good instructional design
models can mediate this challenge.
ARCS Model of Motivational Design
The ARCS Model of Motivational Design is an instructional design process that proposes
that learning is best achieved and occurs most successfully when the learner is actively engaged
19

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
throughout the learning process. The ARCS model provides a framework of motivational
components as well as a design process to attain this type of engagement. The model was
developed by Keller after an extensive literature review on motivation in education settings
(Keller, 1984; Keller 1987). Keller discovered that the majority of concepts around motivation
could be clustered around the categories of attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction
(ARCS), and that these four elements are key to the learning process.
Attention denotes the interest or curiosity that a learner displays in the content being
taught, and is perhaps the most important part of the model because without attention the learner
has no motivation to invest in the topic at hand. In the model, attention is divided into three
groupings that provide instructors with methods to gain attention: perceptual arousal, inquiry
arousal, and variability. Perceptual arousal consists of using surprise, novelty, or uncertainty to
capture learner interest, or using humor to lighten the moment. When using perceptual arousal, it
is important to use specific and concrete examples to which the learner can relate. Using conflict,
inconsistency, providing opposing viewpoints, or playing devil’s advocate can inspire curiosity
in the learner. Inquiry arousal involves gaining active participation from the learner in the form
of hands-on activities or experiences or through questions that encourage critical thinking. This
can be accomplished through case studies, content-related anecdotes, or visual representations of
important ideas or relationships. Instructors might also build in problem solving activities
regularly or allow students to pursue topics of interest to them rather than always assigning
topics of the instructor’s choosing. Variability encompasses using a variety of teaching methods
or provides multiple modes of learning for the learner. This might be achieved through the use of
video, readings, practice tests, chunking material for students, and allowing for both student-led
and instructor-led types of interaction.
20

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Gaining attention from learners is critical, but instructors must also establish relevance
for learners in order to sustain attention. Relevance can be established by assisting learners in
seeing the value and applicability of the content. Keller (1987) presents three strategies for
creating a sense of relevance for learners: goal orientation, motive matching, and familiarity.
Goal orientation is about demonstrating the worth and usefulness of the content. This consists of
illustrating both the current worth, or how the content will assist learners in the present moment,
as well as future usefulness, or how the content will assist learners in the future. Motive
matching involves discovering information about your learners and then matching your delivery
to those motives. For example, needs matching will help an instructor determine why the learners
are there to learn the information. Keller also advocates for choice in the learning process in
terms of allowing learners to have options for learning the material in the way that works best for
them, or having multiple modes of learning available for the students. Establishing trust with
learners is crucial and can be accomplished through opportunities that are no- or low-risk for
interaction. Familiarity is about establishing a sense of applicability for the learner. This can be
done by modeling enthusiasm for the content, using peer-modeling, bringing in role-models who
have used the content in meaningful ways, or showing learners how their own experiences build
the base for the current content. In building familiarity, it is essential that the instructor discover
learner interest and prior knowledge in order to relate the instruction to the learner.
Attention and relevance provide the pillar of the ARCS model, with the next two
components relying on these elements. The confidence piece of the theory posits that belief in
one’s ability to be successful influences how much effort learners put forth into learning the
content. Keller suggests that instructors consider establishing performance requirements, such as
the criteria necessary for success (i.e., clearly stated objectives, grading policies, rubrics, time
21

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
estimates to finish tasks). These requirements support independence and help learners accurately
measure the amount of effort needed to be successful, making it more likely that learners will
actually invest the amount of time necessary. Confidence can also be built by providing
opportunities for learners to be successful in learning activities. Success can be facilitated by
ensuring that learning opportunities and assessments build on one another and that appropriate
scaffolds are provided to ensure attainment of the goals. Showing learners their growth and
progress in the content, as well as providing feedback, will help learners to develop a sense of
belief in themselves. Confidence is also encouraged by instilling a sense of personal control.
When learners feel that their success is due to their own personal abilities and efforts rather than
on external factors such as luck they will feel more in control of the learning process and thereby
feel more confident about their abilities.
The final category of the ARCS model is satisfaction. In order to stay motivated, learners
must acquire some type of fulfillment or enjoyment from the experience. This satisfaction might
come in the form of intrinsic reinforcements such as a sense of achievement, extrinsic
reinforcements, such as positive feedback, certificates of accomplishment or good grades, or
equity, which requires maintaining consistency in evaluation. Allowing students to use new skill
sets in realistic settings or providing opportunities for peer tutoring can enhance a learner’s
feelings of satisfaction. This last category ensures that learners feel good about the experience
and want to learn more.
These categories are the foundation of the ARCS model and set the stage for the planning
process or the instructional design process. The second component of the ARCS model describes
the procedures for designing content. The process can be broken down into the steps of define,
design, develop, and evaluate. The define stage consists of seeking out the motivational problem
22

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
that needs to be solved (i.e., do students perceive a lack of relevance or do they feel a lack of
confidence), analyzing the audience for identification of motivational gaps (i.e., are students
arriving to the course already motivated because of an inherent interest in the topic or have they
arrived with no interest in the subject matter at all), and finally preparing motivational objectives
(i.e., how do you want students to feel at different times in the course). The design stage moves
away from analysis and into creativity as the instructor brainstorms motivation strategies and
then selects the appropriate strategies for the audience. These motivational strategies should
enhance the instruction rather than take away important instructional time. They must be realistic
in terms of time, money, and instructor personality as well as be acceptable to the intended
audience. Once strategies are chosen, they are then developed and integrated into the instruction.
The final phase of evaluation involves assessing the outcomes in terms of both motivation and
learning outcomes to gauge student satisfaction level and then revising if necessary.
Games as a Motivating Force
Motivation and interest are evident in the video game industry. SpilGames estimated that
by the end of 2013 over 1.2 billion people would be playing games on computers, tablets, or
smartphones (NewZoo, 2013). Jane McGonigal, in her book Reality is Broken, states that over
half a billion people play video games for at least an hour a day, while over five million people
in the United States alone play games for at least forty hours per week (2011). Obviously, there
is something about games that attracts us. Seeing this evidence of motivation and interest,
companies, organizations, and educators have begun to seek out what it is that makes games so
appealing.
The appeal can be summarized by four basic characteristics or defining features of
games: goals, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation (McGonigal, 2011). Goals
23

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
are what give a sense of purpose to the player and what focuses the player’s attention. These are
outcomes that a player is working to achieve. Rules are the limits that are put into place
regarding how the goal can be achieved. Putting limits in place that prohibit the player from
reaching a goal in the easiest way possible may require new, creative, or strategic thinking in
order to reach the goal. A feedback system provides information to the player about how close
they are to achieving their goal. The more real-time or immediate the feedback is the more
motivation is provided to keep playing to achieve the goal. Voluntary participation is what helps
to transform what might ordinarily be a stressful or challenging situation into something that is
fun. When players understand and accept the previous characteristics and feel freedom to enter
and leave at will, they have engaged in voluntary participation. Kapp (2012) extends this list by
adding freedom to fail, interest curve, and storytelling. Freedom to fail provides players with the
opportunity to take risks, explore, and experiment rather than playing it safe. This results in
higher engagement and learning, as players can learn as much or more from trying and failing
than succeeding. This is often done by providing multiple lives or even unlimited lives in the
game so that one mistake doesn’t risk the whole game. The interest curve pertains to maintaining
engagement through the flow and sequence of events. This is often accomplished by “hooking”
the user at the beginning to peak interest, and then choosing opportune moments throughout the
game to once again peak interest. Storytelling provides the backdrop to why users are engaging
in actions. Take the popular game Angry Birds as an example (see www.angrybirds.com). The
“story” of Angry Birds is that a group of hungry, green pigs have stolen the birds’ eggs, and the
birds are getting revenge on the pigs (Free Angry Birds Games, 2014). Storytelling puts the
“why” into the gameplay. Taken together, these defining features have the opportunity to provide
the player the motivation trifecta: autonomy, mastery and purpose: (Pink, 2011).

The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics Framework. The Mechanics-DynamicsAesthetics (MDA) Framework (Hunicke, Leblanc, & Zubek, 2004) is a tool for understanding
games and game design. It was developed as a way to help the various parties involved in game
design and development to decompose and study games, but it is also a helpful tool in thinking
about applying game concepts to education, and is cited by many gamification researchers (Kim,
2015b, Kocadere & Caglar, 2015; Zichermann & Cunningham, 2011; Dicheva, Dichev, Agre, &
Angelova, 2015). MDA stands for Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics, though from a
definitions perspective, it’s easiest to understand these aspects in reverse order. Aesthetics are
the feelings and sensations a player has during a game, such as pleasure, fantasy, fellowship,
discovery, challenge, expression, submission, or drama. The dynamics of a game are the design
principles of the game play that build and support the aesthetics. Dynamics can include things
that support and create a sense of challenge, such as time pressure or playing against an opponent.
Mechanics are the specific components of the game, such as the actions, behaviors, and control
given to the player of the game. Mechanics are the rules and other components that direct the
outcome of the game (Kim, 2015b), such as the ghosts, fruit, dots, and exit doors of Pac-Man.
Mechanics support dynamics, and dynamics support aesthetics. In the game Pac-Man, eating one
of the larger dots turns the ghosts blue and allows Pac-Man to eat them for points. These are
mechanics. The timer that begins once Pac-Man eats the large dot is also mechanics because it is
a game rule, but it causes tension and pressure to hurry, which is dynamics, which in turn causes
a sense of challenge, which is aesthetics. One might think about dynamics as the bridge between
the mechanics of the game – the individual technical components – and the aesthetics of the
game – how the user feels. To the game player, the mechanics of the game are the basic rules
that guide game play, but to the game designer the mechanics are the actions and controls that
25

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
the player has. The dynamics are the part of the game that makes it appealing to players, while
game designers view mechanics as the principles of design that allow players to interact with the
specific mechanics of the game. The aesthetics of the game are the game player’s goals and
purpose for playing the game, and for game designers the aesthetics represent the feelings or
responses that they want to create in people (Kim, 2015b).
Game Use in Education. Seeing the attraction and hold that games can have on users,
educators have begun using games or game elements in an attempt to increase motivation to
learn content. This has been accomplished in a variety of ways. Connolly, Boyle, MacArthur, &
Hainey (2012) provide a useful framework for categorizing games: games for entertainment,
games for learning, and serious games. Games for entertainment are those whose primary
purpose and function are fun and entertainment. Angry Birds (see rovio.com), Pac-Man (see
bandainamcoent.com), and Grand Theft Auto (see rockstargames.com) are examples of games
for entertainment. Serious games can be described as games that are used to learn, attain skills,
or train (Cain & Piascik, 2014, Borges et al., 2014). Serious games are complete games that
incorporate elements such as simulations or virtual environments that are used for nonentertainment purposes (Deterding et al., 2011). Most times, serious games employ a high degree
of technology. An example of a serious game might be a simulation game in which the student
raises a virtual child by making series of decisions and watching the outcome. As one might
imagine, serious games require a high degree of technical knowledge that most teachers or
professors do not have, making them a non-viable option for most. In fact, Cain and Piascik
(2015) state that educators who have minimal or no experience or technical background in
designing serious games should not attempt to do so because it can result in bad design, bad
games, or games with little or no effect on learning. Game based learning (GBL) is often used
26

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
interchangeably with the term serious games, but in actuality, GBL is a branch of serious games.
In GBL teachers use games, such as playing a Jeopardy game or a Hollywood Squares game to
teach content. Game based learning can incorporate puzzles, strategy games, and role-playing,
and can range from simple to complex in terms of the technology (Miller Brown, 2013). Serious
games and game based learning use a game as the starting point and apply learning concepts or
information to it. A newer component in the trend of using games in the education arena is
gamification. While serious games use the game as the starting point, gamification in education
uses learning as the starting point.
Gamification
Nick Pelling, an English game designer turned businessman, coined the term
gamification in 2002 when he started to look at ways to make electronic transactions fun and
efficient through the employment of a user-interface that resembled a game (Pelling, 2011). The
term started becoming more widespread in late 2010 as companies began using gamification
components to market their products. While Pelling may have coined the term in the early part of
the decade, a true definition of gamification didn’t emerge until years later. Zichermann &
Cunningham, in their book about web and mobile apps, define gamification as “the process of
game-thinking and game mechanics to engage users and solve problems” (2011, p. xiv).
Deterding et al. (2011) provides perhaps the most widely-used definition of gamification in the
research literature when they describe it as “the use of game design elements in non-game
contexts (pg. 2). Huotari and Hamari (2011) suggest that the definition of gamification needs to
go beyond just a systemic perspective to games and offer an expanded, goal oriented definition
of gamification as “a process of enhancing a service with affordances for gameful experiences in
order to support user’s overall value creation” (p. 19). Kapp (2012) states that gamification is
27

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
“using game-based mechanics, aesthetics, and game thinking to engage people, motivate action,
promote learning, and solve problems” (p. 10). Domínguez, Saenz-De-Navarrete, de-Marcos,
Fernández-Sanz (2013) narrowed the definition of gamification as “incorporating game elements
into a non-gaming software application to increase user experience and engagement” (p. 381).
Gartner, an information technology research and advisory company, redefined gamification in
2014 as “the use of game mechanics and experience design to digitally engage and motivate
people to achieve their goals” (Burke, 2014, “Gartner Redefines Gamification,” para. 1). Leaning
(2015) combines these ideas into an expanded definition when he states:
gamification partly then involves adding a different form of experience to an activity,
adding a new layer to an existing process that incorporates a new level of symbolic or
ludic meaning above and beyond the merely instrumental activity of the task. The new
layer of meaning provides a greater experience for the user and encourages participation
with the transformed activity” (p. 159).
What these definitions have in common is that gamification is about taking the elements of
games that seem to motivate people and provide engagement and enjoyment to people and using
those elements in some type of non-game context to achieve the same goals of motivating,
engaging, and enjoying an activity. It involves taking an activity that already exists and adding a
layer to that activity in order to change the user’s experience.
While the term gamification may be new, the idea of gamification has been around for
quite some time. In 1896, retailer Sperry & Hutchinson (S&H) rewarded loyal customers with
green stamps which could be redeemed for products in its rewards catalog, and in the early
1980’s airlines and hotels began offering frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs as incentives
to use their services (eLearning Industry, 2014). Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts offer merit
28

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
badges to showcase the achievements of specific skill sets (Boy Scouts of America, 2016; Girl
Scouts of the United States of America, 2016).
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Volkswagen gained attention in 2009 with their “Fun Theory
Initiative” (Volkswagen, 2009). The initiative’s purpose was to try to change people’s behavior
by doing something fun. Perhaps the best known example from the Fun Theory Initiative was the
musical staircase in the Odenplan train station in Stockholm. Could making the stairs fun
actually encourage more people to choose walking up the stairs over taking the escalator?
Engineers made changes to the original staircase in the train station and turned it into a
functioning set of musical keys resembling a piano with both white and black keys. Walking up
this musical staircase resulted in a scale being played, complete with sharps and flats upon
stepping on the black sections of the stair. An escalator resided right next to the staircase.
Commuters began taking the staircase more often than the escalator. In fact, 66% more people
chose the stairs over the escalator, indicating that indeed, making something fun could change
behavior.
With the rapid increase in personal computers, tablets, and smart phones, the stage was
set to take gamification to new levels (Kim, 2015a). Other initiatives to change behavior
followed. In the same year, Foursquare introduced a social networking application that awarded
badges, points, and mayor status to players who “checked in” at various locations (Rimon, 2014).
Players had to be within a certain distance of the location in order to check in, and were able to
leave comments and tips for other guests. By 2015, the company had over 60 million users
registered, 50 million of whom were active, and boasted more than 75 million tips from users.
Another Volkswagen Fun Theory Initiative was the Speed Camera Lottery, set up in Stockholm
to encourage drivers to drive the speed limit (Volkswagen, 2010). The Speed Camera Lottery
29

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
machine photographed cars driving by. Those who were speeding received a citation and fine.
Those who were going the speed limit were entered into a lottery that was funded by the money
earned from the citations. In the three days the camera was up, over 24,000 cars passed. The
average speed went down 22% from 32 kilometers per hour to 25.
With gamification ideas popping up in a variety of service industries, other companies
and organizations began to realize that the same strategies might work for them. Khan Academy
uses game mechanics to motivate students to learn new skills by using skill-growth trees and
badges (see www.KhanAcademy.org). Even the US Department of Education got into the
gamification arena with the Race to the Top grant program. Grant applications were evaluated on
a point basis, with a maximum point value of 500 points. States with the highest point values
were awarded the largest grants (Shea, 2014). Software companies have gamified their programs
in an effort to help people learn new skills. Microsoft has an add-on called Microsoft Ribbon
Hero that encourages people to explore new tools through the use of points, badges, and levels
(www.ribbonhero.com). Jigsaw is a tool that attempts to help users learn Photoshop by having
them match a target image (Dong et al., 2012). Numerous fitness apps have also emerged with
gamification components, including Nike+, Fitbit, and Blue Shield’s MeYou Health (see
badgeville.com/wiki/health).
Gamification in action. Gamification incorporates the defining features of games, but in
less prominent ways, so it is no wonder that it has become such a popular concept. However,
effective gamification doesn’t just put a point system or a badge system onto an existing service.
Cheong, Filippou, and Cheong (2014) warn against adding surface level gamification
components such as points, commonly referred to as “pointsification” (Robertson, 2010),
because these rarely have lasting benefits. Instead, they suggest three features for optimal
30

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
execution: (1) understanding the end-user’s characteristics, (2) deciding on the objective of the
activity, or what the end user should do, and (3) choosing the right gamification component to
motivate the user. A defining characteristic of these features is that choosing the gamification
feature comes only after evaluating the user’s characteristics and deciding on the objective.
Understanding and applying these features may help to avoid the novelty effect of gamification
in which users are excited upon introduction of the features but quickly lose interest (Farzan et
al., 2008, Koivisto & Hamari, 2014).
Flow. The user’s end experience is what makes the gamification component value-added.
Not only should the experience be fun, but the user should be engaged. One theory of
engagement in the gaming world is that of flow (Csikszentmihalyi & LeFevre, 1989). Flow
theory suggests that experiences will be more positive when the environment contains challenges
that are matched with the person’s skills (Csikszentmihalyi & LeFevre, 1989). If games are too
challenging for a player’s skill level, the player may become anxious or disheartened and give up.
If the game is too easy for the player’s skill level, the player is likely to become bored and quit.
When the challenges are matched to the skill level, and the challenges become increasingly more
difficult as the game progresses, then the stage has been set to achieve flow. Flow is experienced
when the end user becomes absorbed in the activity, and is characterized by energy, focus,
involvement, and success (Shin, 2006). Users who experience flow states are more likely to learn
new skills and increase self-esteem. Flow results in more exploratory behaviors, satisfaction, and
increased learning (Csikszentmihalyi & LeFevre, 1989; Hoffman & Novak, 1996). Interestingly,
people are more likely to experience flow in work situations than in leisure activities, but even in
leisure activities the quality of experience is strongly influenced by a state of flow
(Csikszentmihalyi & LeFevre, 1989).
31

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Meaningful Gamification. The three ideas of defining features, flow, and the MDA
Framework lead to the notion of meaningful gamification. Nicholson (2012) promotes the idea of
meaningful gamification as a solution to the motivation issue brought forth by Ryan and Deci
(2000) regarding motivation. In meaningful gamification, careful attention is paid to making the
gamification components meaningful to the end user in hope of achieving flow and to therefore
maintain or even increase intrinsic motivation so that there is less emphasis on external rewards.
The defining features give us a structure for thinking about gamification components, and the
MDA Framework provides a guide for thinking about the user’s end experience and the goals we
hope to accomplish or feelings we hope to create in the user. Rather than selecting gamification
components for the sake of gamification and fun, meaningful gamification requires thoughtful
selection of components that will hopefully create a sense of flow for the user. In education,
creating flow results in sustained attention and motivation for learning the content of the class.
This process of creating sustained attention and motivation begins with course design, and the
ARCS Model of Motivational Design provides guidance for creating the backdrop for
meaningful gamification. The model sets the stage for choosing effective gamification
components.
Gamification in Education. Gamification is a new but growing trend, as evidenced by
Google analytics. The first search hit on Google appeared in April of 2010 (see
https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=gamification), with the first evidence of publications
related to education appearing in 2011 (Dicheva et al., 2015). While many opinion articles,
books, reviews, and conference papers exist on the topic, the amount of empirical studies on
gamification are few. Hamari, Koivisto, & Pakkanen (2014) conducted a systematic literature
review on empirical studies in gamification in general, resulting in 24 studies. Of the 24 articles,
32

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
the most common mechanics were points, leader boards, and badges. Hamari et al. (2014) cite
several shortcomings in the studies reviewed, including small sample sizes, instruments used,
lack of control groups, lack of individual components being investigated, presenting only
descriptive statistics, short time frames, and lack of clarity in the results. Of the studies, only nine
were related to education or learning. Borges et al. (2014) compiled a list of 26 articles related to
how gamification has been investigated in connection to education. Of the 26 articles included in
the mapping, most were conference papers, book reviews, or book chapters related to either
gamification, serious games, or game based learning. Only one article was an empirical study on
gamification in educational settings.
Dicheva et al. (2015) reviewed empirical studies to determine the types of educational
contexts to which gamification has been applied as well as the specific game elements that have
been used. The mapping resulted in a set of 34 studies, but many of the studies cited lacked data
to support the claims (i.e., Akloplat & Slany, 2014; Bartel & Hagel, 2014; dy Byl & Hooper,
2013; Giannetto, Chao, & Fontana, 2013; Hentenryck & Coffrin, 2014; Holman, Aguilar, &
Fishman, 2013; Mitchell, Danino, & May, 2013; Morrison & DiSalvo, 2014; Pirker, RiffnallerSchiefer, & Gütl, 2014; Thomas & Berkling, 2013; Todor & Pitica, 2013; Werbach & Johnson,
2012). The most popular game design principles used were visual status (use of point systems or
leader boards in which status is visible to others), social engagement (competition among
students or cooperation and integration with other students), freedom of choice (allowing
students to choose projects or assignment types or choose deadlines or class guidelines), freedom
to fail (allowing revisions on assignments with no penalties), and rapid feedback. In terms of the
most popular game mechanisms used, the most popular were badges, points, leader boards, and
levels. In practice, few of the studies differentiate between game design principles and game
33

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
mechanisms, and there is dispute among where gamification components fall in those categories.
In their conclusion, the authors conclude that many of the empirical studies lack proper
evaluation, as evidenced by the lack of data mentioned above. More research is needed to
investigate specific game elements in isolation.
The choices in selecting gamification components are limited only by one’s imagination.
The gamification wiki (see https://badgeville.com/wiki/Game_Mechanics) provides a list of 24
different game mechanics, but as evidenced by the mapping studies above, the most often
discussed mechanics in research literature are points, leader boards, badges and levels (Dicheva
et al, 2015; Huotari & Hamari, 2012). One limitation with many of the studies is the fact that
most studies lump a collection of gamification components together for evaluation, so the effects
on motivation or student achievement cannot be isolated to a single gamification component. Of
the 23 studies on gamification related to education that have at least some data to support the
claims, only six studies focused on a single component of gamification, with three articles on
badges (Abramovich, Schunn, & Higashi, 2013; Fanfarelli & McDaniel, 2015; Hakulinen,
Auvinen, & Korhonen, 2015), one article on leader boards (Banfield & Wilkerson, 2014), one
article on experience points (Burkey, Anastasio, & Suresh, 2013), and one article on freedom to
fail (though true empirical data is absent from this article) (Gibbons, 2013).
Badges. Course badges are digital icons that are awarded upon achieving specified
criteria. They differ from the open badging concept. Open badges are badges that are awarded
for skill sets obtained, and they travel with the user. Mozilla Open Badges are an example of an
open badging system in which users can display the badges they have earned in their Mozilla
Backpack for others to see. Purdue University has adopted a badging system called Passport that
is compatible with Mozilla Backpack (Bowen & Thomas, 2014), but for most instructors any
34

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
type of college-wide adoption is far off. Course badges, in contrast to open badges, are specific
to a single course and serve the purpose of motivating students or changing student behavior.
Badges have been used in a variety of ways in courses. Badges can be awarded for achievement
of a specific grade, turning in assignments before the deadline, participation, or any other
behavior the instructor wishes to target. In the studies that focused either solely on badges or
those that were able to report data or perceptions on the badge component, the results were
mixed. Badges seem to impact the social aspect of courses in a positive way when the badging
system is voluntary; however, most times the cognitive impact is not significant.
In most cases, badges were associated with changes in student behavior. Hakulinen,
Auvinen & Korhonen (2015) implemented a voluntary badge system in a university level data
structure and algorithm course. Badges had a statistically significant impact on some aspects of
student behavior, such as spending more time in the learning environment, time management,
and carefulness. Denny (2013) incorporated badges and a point system into an online system in
which students can create multiple choice questions. Results suggested that badges significantly
increased the quantity of student contributions. Haaranen, Ihantola, Hakulinen, & Korhonen
(2014) found the opposite findings. They implemented badges in a university blended data
structures and algorithms course. Badges were awarded for learning, time management, and
carefulness in three different levels. Badges were not shared among students. Results suggested
that badges did not have a significant effect on behavior.
Learner characteristics are an important component to consider in implementing a
badging system, and badging systems may not be beneficial for all students (Abramovich et al.,
2014; Fanfarelli & McDaniel, 2015). Abramovich et al. (2013) studied badging with middle
school students in a mathematics tutoring system. Badges were awarded to students based on
35

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
both participation in the tutoring system and skill mastery. Results revealed that patterns of
earning badges differed across students with different levels of prior knowledge, and that the
different badge types offered affected learners differently. It is difficult to generalize these results
to a higher education setting based on the fact that extrinsic motivators may have different, and
even harmful, effects on children than for adults (Deci & Ryan, 2001; Henderlong & Lepper,
2002). Fanfarelli and McDaniel (2015) examined badges through the lens of Long-Dziuban
reactive behavior types and traits. Results revealed that passive learners did not benefit from the
badging system to the same extent as aggressive learners, and scored lower on measures of
higher order learning, reflective and integrative learning, engagement, and intrinsic motivation
even if earning equivalent badges. In addition, students with impulsiveness or phobia showed
reduced scores, indicating that badging systems may not be a good idea for this type of student.
Student satisfaction increased with the number of badges earned.
Student perceptions around badges seem to be mostly positive. Haaranen et al., (2014)
found that students claimed more motivation and positive behavior changes, though a few
students claimed that badges were elementary. Denny (2013) found that student perceptions were
positive and indicated that students preferred having badges in the course, but authors warn that
results may be due to the highly competitive nature of the program and may not be generalizable.
Domínguez et al. (2013) reported student perceptions of the gamified version were mostly
positive, though some students found the leaderboard discouraging. Haaranen et al. (2014)
reported mixed student perceptions on the badges, with some reactions being very negative,
some indifferent, and some very positive. Hanus & Fox (2015) had the most negative results in
regards to badges. They incorporated required badge completion and a leaderboard. Results
suggest that students in the gamified course displayed less motivation, satisfaction, and
36

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
empowerment than students in the control condition over time. This indicates that choice in
whether to participate in the badging components may be an important indicator of student
perception.
While student perceptions seem mostly positive for badges, the effect on achievement
may be questionable. Only four of the studies collected information about student achievement,
and most said that badges had no significant effect on grades (Domínguez et al., 2013; Haaranen
et al., 2014; Hanus & Fox, 2015). Though final grades were not significantly different in the
Hanus & Fox (2015) study, final exam scores were mediated by level of intrinsic motivation,
which had declined over time in the gamified course. The authors state that the forced badge
completion may have contributed to the decreased motivation. Domínguez et al. (2013) designed
a gamification plug-in for an e-learning platform using badges and leader boards. Students in the
gamified experience scored better on practical assignments but there were no significant
differences in overall score with the exception that students who earned at least six achievements
have a significantly higher score. Results suggest that students in the gamified version scored
poorly on written assignments and participated less.
Leader boards. Leader boards provide students with an idea of their own performance in
relation to the rest of the group. One significant issue with leader boards is compliance with
FERPA regulations. In order to institute a leader board system in the classroom, avatars or
nicknames would need to be used to protect student assessment information. Banfield and
Wilkerson (2014) had the only study that isolated leader boards. They implemented experiential
learning theory in the classroom with case study challenges and leader boards. Students from the
gamified section were more able to organize knowledge and connect it to existing knowledge.
Qualitative themes suggested that compared to a control group, students in the gamified section
37

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
were more intrinsically motivated and enjoyed the course more while students in the nongamified section were more extrinsically motivated. A major limitation of the study is that the
challenges were a significant teaching mechanism that the control group lacked. It seems that
this study might have been more a measure of whether active learning or didactic teaching works
best rather than an evaluation of the gamification component of leader boards. O’Donovan, Gain,
& Marais (2013) discovered that students rated the leader board the most motivating element of
the course. In other cases in which leader boards were used, results suggest that leader boards
may actually inhibit active participation and confidence. An emphasis on competition through
the user of leader boards may have resulted in limited participation in the gamified version of an
undergraduate technology course, even though student perceptions of the gamified version were
positive (de-Marcos et al., 2014). Other studies reveal that students found leader boards
discouraging and had negative opinions concerning the leader boards (Frost, Matta, & MacIvor,
2015; Kocadere & Caglar, 2015).
Freedom to fail. Freedom to fail revolves around the video game concept that there is a
low cost to failure because you can always start over, and that through failure and playing the
game over and over, learning occurs and success is achieved. Rather than requiring revision of
work as might be seen in an English Composition course which requires repeated attempts of
compositions through the use of drafts, freedom to fail allows voluntary reattempts, invoking a
sense of autonomy and choice. Freedom to fail may reduce anxiety in a course. Gibbons (2013)
examined gamification concepts in terms of anxiety using two case studies. He implemented
choices throughout the course along with freedom to fail. Eighty percent (80%) of the students
found the course less stressful even though the project was designed to be more challenging in
the gamified version. Gordon, Brayshaw, & Grey (2013) implemented freedom to fail and leader
38

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
boards in a university mathematics course. While strong empirical data is missing from the paper,
the authors attempt to make the case that allowing multiple attempts improves final grades.
While this is an admirable goal, further research is needed to determine if the increase in final
grade was actually an increase in learning or merely an increase in points earned.
Experience points (XP). Experience points, commonly referred to as XP, are points that
are gained by accomplishing specific tasks within a course. There is no one agreed-upon way of
assigning XP, as each course seems to use them in different ways. Only one study focused solely
on experience points. Burkey, Anastasio, and Suresh (2013) used XP that translated into a
traditional grade. Students were able to perform optional tasks to earn extra XP for what ended
up being extra credit. No statistical difference in grades were discovered from previous nongamified version to the gamified version. Student perceptions were positive, claiming more
interest and engagement and they preferred the gamified version to traditional courses. In reality,
the addition of XP alone likely did little in the way of gamifying the course since it was a surface
level component. Use of the surface level components such as simply adding points are what
some have termed “pointsification,” or “taking the thing that is least essential to games and
representing it as the core of the experience” (Robertson, 2010, p. 1).
Studies with positive results. Of the remaining studies, the effects of individual
components were not reported, and it becomes difficult to generalize any of the findings.
Therefore the remainder of these studies will be reported upon based on whether the studies
reported positive results, mixed results, or negative results. Leaning (2015) incorporated leader
boards and games for the lectures of a university level media theory course. Qualitative data
indicated that students enjoyed the gamified components, put more effort into the course, and
thought that the components aided their learning. However, comparison of grades indicated a
39

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
small, but not significant difference, which is puzzling considering that students reported putting
more effort into the course. More effort should, theoretically, transmit into higher grades.
Leaning concluded that perhaps the gamified aspects of the course were not measuring the same
aspects deemed important for the final course grade. In other words, there was a mismatch
between what was gamified and the assessments in the course.
O’Donovan, Gain, & Marais (2013) incorporated storyline, experience points, badges,
levels, and a leaderboard into a game design course. Student perceptions of the course were
positive, with the leaderboard being the most motivating of the gamification elements as
previously reported. Data revealed higher lecture attendance as compared to other courses in the
department and significantly improved grades as compared to the previous year.
Other studies that reported positive effects did not have the empirical evidence to support
changes in grades and reported mostly perception data. Leong & Yanjie (2011) built an online
learning platform that incorporated experience points, levels, a leaderboard, and a storyline.
While true empirical data is missing from the article, the authors state that the gamified course
improved engagement, improved the learning process, and improved interaction with the tutors
in the platform. Student perception data reveal that the course was more interesting, and they
were more motivated. Iosup & Epema (2014) implemented points, badges, levels, leader boards,
unlocking content, and freedom to fail in a university course. While empirical data regarding
achievement is missing, student perceptions of the gamified experience were positive, and
instructors reported higher levels of lecture attendance and participation with a gamified version
of the course. Landers & Callan, 2011 created a social networking site in which badges for
successful completion of optional quizzes in a university psychology class would be displayed.
While most of the data for this study revolves around the development of the social networking
40

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
site, students report being motivated to take the optional tests due to the badging system. Goehle
(2013) developed an online mathematics homework system which implemented a leveling
system, experience points, and badges. The study did not focus on statistical data since there was
no control group, but reported that student perceptions were mostly positive. The study provides
more in the way of improvements to the homework system than empirical data to evaluate the
specific components.
Studies with mixed results. Five of the studies reported mixed results from the
gamification components. Given that these studies combined several components into one study,
this could account for the results. In a 5 year study, Barata et al. (2013) compared 3 years of a
non-gamified course and 2 years of a gamified course. The results displayed a significant
increase in student attendance the first year, but a decrease in attendance during the second year.
Students in the gamified version downloaded lecture slides significantly more and posted in
activity forums significantly more. There were no statistically significant differences in grades,
but final grades in the first year dropped, while final grades in the second year were the highest
ever seen. Students perceived the gamified course as more motivating and more interesting than
non-gamified courses. An undergraduate technology course with a blended approach used
challenges, levels, badges, and a leaderboard (de-Marcos et al., 2014). Results in regards to
scores on assignments were mixed with the control group outperforming the gamified group on
assessments of knowledge but the gamified group performing better on practical assignments. As
previously reported, the limited participation in the gamified version could have been attributed
to the emphasis on competition, though student perceptions of the course were positive. De
Schutter & Abeele (2014) used an online application to incorporate gamification components of
avatars, quests, storyline, experience points (XP), and leader boards. Though this seemed to be
41

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
more of a serious game rather than true gamification, the authors termed the study gamification
and it was included in the mapping study by Dicheva et al. (2015); therefore, the results are
provided here. The gamified course did not display higher levels of intrinsic motivation or
engagement compared to the traditional course. Results revealed that factors such as the
instructor and teaching materials carried more weight in facilitating intrinsic motivation. Student
perceptions around the avatars and storyline were mixed, and overall students needed more
clarity about the gamified components. The covariates of teacher effectiveness, classroom
atmosphere, clarity of the course, competence development, prior interest, and game playing
time accounted for 83% of the variance in intrinsic motivation in the course, eliminating any
significant differences between the gamified and non-gamified versions of the courses. Frost,
Matta, and MacIvor (2015) used a storyline, badges, experience points, leader boards, and lives
(in the form of late submission opportunities) in a blended university business course. Results
indicated that although student interest and relatedness were improved (though only slightly
significant) there were no significant differences in grades. Student perceptions were mostly
positive, though as reported previously many students believed that the leaderboard was
discouraging. Kocadere & Caglar (2015) incorporated avatars, levels, content unlocking,
freedom to fail, leaderboard, achievements, badges, and points in assessment practices in an
undergraduate course. Positive student perceptions included enjoyment of the assessment process,
engagement in the assessment process (flow), more motivation, the ability to learn while doing
an assessment, and low anxiety on tests. Negative opinions included the leaderboard and content
unlocking. A significant limitation of the study was that it only had 11 students.
Studies with negative results. Only two studies reported negative results. In addition to
the Hanus & Fox (2011) study previously discussed, Berkling and Thomas (2013) also found
42

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
negative results for a software engineering course in a German University which incorporated
progress bars, freedom to fail on quizzes, experience points (XP) for collaboration and
supporting other students. The gamification components were built into a specialized platform
for the purpose of gamification, muddying the waters between serious games and gamification.
Survey results revealed that student perceptions of games were very different than what
American research literature states about gaming. Qualitative results revealed that students did
not welcome the gamification components and preferred straight-forward teacher-centered
teaching over the student-centered, autonomous style that was provided in the current course.
The need for more empirical research. As evidenced by the limited number of articles
described herein on gamification components, and with a portion of those lacking true empirical
data, it becomes obvious that the research on gamification in educational settings is rather
limited. Most of the available literature on gamification that claims benefits are either
hypothesized or experienced based (Kim, 2015c). In reviewing the mapping studies or
systematic reviews of literature related to gamification that have been completed, the need for
more empirical studies becomes quite clear (Borges et al., 2014; Dicheva et al., 2015; Hamari et
al., 2014). In addition to the need for more empirical studies, it is a necessity that the studies
isolate gamification components in order to determine which components are contributing to the
beneficial changes, which are ineffective, and which are negative in influence. Only when that
research is complete will instructors be able to package gamification components together that
lead to the desired outcomes consistently.

Chapter 3
Research Design and Methodology
Motivation and engagement are important dynamics for success in college coursework.
With the increase in online courses in teacher education, instructors have turned to gamification
to promote more motivation and engagement. There is a dearth of research on the effectiveness
of specific gamification components, and the results of the research that does exist have been
varied.
The primary aim of this mixed methods study is to isolate the gamification components
of unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking to determine which components, if any, improve
student achievement. As part of the analysis student motivation will be assessed using the
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, McKeachie, 1993;
Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1991), administered at the beginning of the course to
determine how learner characteristics at the beginning of the course influence the effect of the
gamification component. A secondary purpose is to analyze student perceptions of the gamified
components, via an end-of-course reflection assignment and a course evaluation survey, using
these perceptions to explain or enhance the quantitative data regarding student achievement.
Research Questions
The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects that three specific
gamification components have on achievement for students in an online child development
course at a Midwestern university. The independent variable will be defined as the type of
gamification component. Three gamification components will be evaluated including unlimited
lives, badges, and level-locking. The dependent variable is student achievement.

44

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Research Question 1: How do specific gamification components affect student
achievement?
Research Question 2: Is there a significant difference in achievement in extrinsically
motivated students versus intrinsically motivated students in a
gamified online course?
Research Question 3: What are student perceptions of the gamified components of
unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking in an online course?
Research Question 4: How do student perceptions of a gamified course correlate with
data regarding student achievement?
Course for Data Collection
The course chosen to be redesigned to include gamification components and used for data
collection was Introductory Child Development, a course in an Early Childhood Education
program in a Midwestern university. The course was an asynchronous, online course with no
synchronous components. This course is required by two undergraduate programs at the
university: 1) an online two or four year non-licensure program focusing on children from birth
through age five and 2) an on-campus four year licensure program focusing on children from
age three through grade three. The online program requires that this Introductory Child
Development course be taken within the first two semesters of enrolling in the program. The oncampus program requires this course to be taken during first semester of the sophomore year of
enrollment. The course is also required for the Early Childhood Education minor for non-early
childhood majors. All students, regardless of program, are enrolled in the same online course to
complete this requirement. The course has a Breadth of Knowledge (BoK) designation of Social
45

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Science, so students in other programs in the university who need a Social Science BoK
sometimes enroll to meet the BoK requirement for their program.
The course was redesigned prior to the start of summer semester of 2015 to incorporate
and evaluate principles of design that have been part of other university courses. The content of
the course and the assignments for the course were agreed upon during meetings between the
researcher (also the instructional designer for the department) and the head of the program.
Assignments were developed to build upon one another within the major topics of the course,
beginning with knowledge based assignments and moving gradually towards assignments that
required application of the knowledge. The course was offered during summer semester to work
out any errors, kinks, or discrepancies, and data collection began during fall semester of 2016.
The course contained a total of 14 modules with each module being one week in length. The
topics of the modules were as follows:


Module 1: Historical and Current Views of Development



Module 2: Observing Young Children



Module 3: Biological Beginnings



Module 4: Prenatal Development



Module 5: Birth



Module 6: Brain Development



Module 7: Physical and Motor Development



Module 8: Physical and Motor Development continued



Module 9: Cognitive Development



Module 10: Cognitive Development continued



Module 11: Language Development
46

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE


Module 12: Social Emotional Development



Module 13: Social Emotional Development continued



Module 14: Play and Development

Each module began on a Monday and ended on a Sunday. All modules held a similar
structure, and contained the following components:


Module Overview – contained a short description of the content to be studied for the
module. The overview was accompanied by a picture designed to grab the attention of
students.



Learning Outcomes – contained the module level learning outcomes as well as how
those outcomes linked to the course level outcomes.



Checklist – contained a list with due dates of all work that was required for the
module.



Readings – contained a list of all textbook readings as well as links to any
supplemental reading required.



Media – contained lectures and videos to supplement the readings.



Assignment links – these links contained descriptions of the assignments, rubrics for
grading, and the submission portal for turning in each assignment. Assignment links
varied within each module, but could include quizzes, discussion boards, blogs,
assignments, or exams.

The grading of the course was based on a weighted percentage, with the following
allocations:


Discussion Boards/Participation – 20%

47

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE


The introduction discussion occurred during the first week of the course. It was
worth ten points, and the score was presented to students as a percent of total
points earned.



The other two discussions were two weeks in length and occurred during Weeks
three-four and weeks eight-nine. Each discussion was worth 20 points and was
presented to students as a percent of total points earned.



Check Your Knowledge Quizzes – 15%


A total of 7 quizzes, occurred during Weeks 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 13. Quizzes
varied in length from 20 questions to 42 questions, and each question was worth
one point each, with the grade portrayed as the total percentage of questions
correct. Quizzes covered all material that had not been previously included on a
quiz; i.e., Quiz 1 covered the content for module one, Quiz 3 covered the content
for modules two and three. All quizzes were timed and allowed one and a half
minutes per question. The questions were displayed one at a time; answer choices
were randomized with each attempt; questions were randomized with each
attempt; and students were unable to backtrack to previous questions once an
answer had been submitted.



Written Homework Assignments – 25%


Consisted of a variety of small written assignments which varied depending on
the topic. Assignments were: Reflection on the Influences on Development (10
points); Observation Practice (10 points); Early Childhood Organizations Paper
(20 points), Parent Newsletter (10 points); Physical and Motor Development
Definitions (10 points); Infant Cognitive Development Homework (20 points);
48

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Preschool Cognitive Development Homework (10 points); Social Emotional
Development Homework (10 points); Social Competence Homework (10 points);
Reflection on Play and the Semester (10 points)


Written Major Papers – 30%


These application assignments required students to observe a child between the
ages of birth and 5 years of age and apply the knowledge from the course to the
child’s development in a series of written papers (30 points each). Papers
included: Physical and Motor Development Observation Paper; Cognitive and
Language Development Observation Paper; Social-Emotional Observation Paper



Final Exam – 10%


The final exam was 100 questions in length (100 points) and consisted of
questions from the Check Your Knowledge Quizzes.

To ensure that students were receiving similar experiences across conditions, weekly
announcements for each section contained the same information for each condition. In addition,
to ensure that students felt a sense of relatedness to the instructors, researcher instructions within
certain course modules gave instructors directions for communicating with students, such as
sending emails out about grades or progress within the course. This practice had been piloted in
other courses within the program with success, and again served to ensure similarity of
communication with students across conditions.
Treatment Conditions
Three separate sections of the course were created within the learning management
system, Blackboard 9.1. Each section contained the same syllabus, calendar, content (including
quizzes and assignments), and announcements. Each section contained a different gamification
49

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
component as the treatment condition. The sections were labeled to students as Section 1,
Section 2, or Section 3, and had no verbiage alluding to gamification components. In each
section, adaptive release was used to reveal one week of content at a time. Content became
available on the Friday prior to the start of the next week.
Section 1 was the Unlimited Lives section. In this section, students were able to take the
Check Your Knowledge Quizzes as many times as they wished until they earned the score with
which they were satisfied. This was emphasized in the directions for each quiz, as well as in the
announcements for the weeks containing the quizzes. In addition, students were able to re-do any
written assignment for which they received a grade of 75% or below. Students were able to
return to any previous modules to submit work at any time up until the end of Week 13.
Section 2 was the Level-Locking section. In this section, students were required to score
at least 80% or above in order to unlock the next week’s content when a Check Your Knowledge
quiz was available. For example, in Week 1, students had to score 80% on the Week 1 Check
Your Knowledge quiz in order to see Week 2 content. If a student scored 80% on the quiz
sometime during the week, the Week 2 content would open up on Friday at noon. However, if
the student had not yet scored 80% on the quiz by Friday at noon, Week 2 would not be visible
until the student reached 80% on the prior week’s quiz. On weeks in which no Check Your
Knowledge quiz was present, content opened on Friday at noon as long as the student had passed
the previous Check Your Knowledge quiz. Students were able to take the Check Your
Knowledge Quizzes as many times as they wished until they earned the required score of 80%.
They were also free to continue taking the quizzes to earn a higher score even after the 80% was
reached in order to earn the score with which they were satisfied. This was emphasized in the
directions for each quiz, as well as in the announcements for the weeks containing the quizzes. In
50

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
addition, students were able to re-do any written assignment for which they received a grade of
75% or below. Students were able to return to any previous modules to submit work at any time
up until the end of Week 13.
Section 3 was the Badges section. In this section, students were able to take the Check
Your Knowledge Quizzes as many times as they wished until they earned the score with which
they were satisfied. If the student earned a score of at least 80%, the student earned a badge, or
achievement. Since the Blackboard learning management system called the function
“achievements,” this is how they were labeled to students. The ability to take the quizzes
unlimited times was emphasized in the directions for each quiz, as well as in the announcements
for the weeks containing the quizzes. The ability to earn an achievement, or badge, was also
emphasized in the announcements each week. In the week following a quiz, the instructor posted
a list of the achievements with the number of students who had earned that achievement. If a
student earned 80% or above, a message displayed on the student’s computer screen
congratulating him/her on obtaining the achievement upon completion of the quiz. In addition,
students had a button in their course navigation menu labeled “My Achievements” which
displayed all of the achievements that could be earned as well as the achievements that student
had already earned. Achievements included:


Master of the Historical Views of Development



Guru of Nature vs. Nurture



Sensei of Prenatal Development



Ruler of Brain Development



Chief of Physical and Motor Development



Commander of Cognitive Development
51

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE


Champion of Social Emotional Development

If a student earned all seven achievements/badges, the student also earned an eighth
achievement/badge entitled “Admiral of Child Development.” This badge provided the student
with a printable certificate of achievement for the course. In addition, students were able to re-do
any written assignment for which they received a grade of 75% or below. Students were able to
return to any previous modules to submit work at any time up until the end of Week 13.
Two instructors taught the three sections and were randomly assigned to one of three
sections, each of which had a different treatment condition. One instructor taught both the
Unlimited Lives and Badges sections, and the other instructor taught the Level-Locking section.
University regulations regarding teaching load prohibited the same instructor from teaching all
three sections. Instructors communicated with one another and the researcher regularly to ensure
that the sections were being taught as similarly as possible, and to ensure that the feedback on
assignments, grading of assignments, policies, and communication was similar. For example, at
one point at the end of the course, the instructors decided that they would no longer accept
assignment revisions after Week 13 so that they could bring the course to a close and grade the
final assignments before grades were due.
Participants and Sampling
This study has a non-human subjects IRB determination, therefore consent was not
required since the data collected for this study consisted of data that was being collected for
continuous program improvement across a variety of courses within the department. As a result,
students in this course were unaware that research was being conducted on the extant data or that
the course contained sections with different treatment conditions.

52

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
One hundred twenty five (125) undergraduate students enrolled in an Introductory Child
Development course online in the fall semester of 2016. All students signed up for one section of
Introductory Child Development using the University’s online registration system. This was the
only section of this course offered at this campus. In order to conduct the research using three
treatment conditions, this meta-course site was never made available for students. Instead, the
researcher created three “dummy” sections within Blackboard. These three “dummy” sections
were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions (unlimited lives, level-locking,
and badges) before the semester started and were labeled Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3.
The instructors were randomly assigned to the three sections. One instructor taught the sections
containing the badges and unlimited lives. The other instructor taught the section containing
level-locking.
In order to randomly assign students to the three treatment conditions, the researcher used
the randomized group feature within the original section of the course which contained all of the
students. This randomly placed an equal number of students into three groups labeled Section 1,
2, and 3. The students were then manually enrolled by the researcher into the corresponding
“dummy” sections.
Table 1 displays the total number of students originally assigned to each section, the
students who officially and unofficially withdrew from each section, and the total number of
students remaining in each section. Five students withdrew during the first week of the course,
and were not recorded in the registrar’s record for the class. Three additional students
electronically withdrew from the course within the official university dates for withdraws (during
the first 9 weeks). This left 117 students in the course. Of these 117 students, eleven students

53

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
stopped participating in the course at some point but never officially withdrew from the course
and thus earned a UW (unofficial withdraw) as a grade.
Since none of the students who officially withdrew from the course completed any
demographic information, it is not possible to evaluate differences between those students and
the students who remained in the class. Of the 11 students who received a UW in the course, 7
students completed demographic information. A one-way between subjects ANOVA was
conducted to evaluate potential differences between students who received a grade of UW and
those who completed the course. There was no significant difference between the groups at an
alpha level of 0.05 (see Table 2). Therefore only the 106 students who participated in and
completed the course (36 in Unlimited Lives, 36 in Level-Locking, and 34 in Badges) will be
included in all further analysis.

students (33%) indicated that the content seemed interesting, one chose it because it seemed like
an easy elective, four (4%) indicated that it fulfilled a Breadth of Knowledge (BoK) requirement
for their program, and 22 (21%) indicated that they chose it because it fit into their schedule.
Results are provided here but will not be used in any further analyses because validity of these
answers are questionable. For example, while only 90 students claimed the course was required
for their program, 94 of the students were in majors which required it. Only one student claimed
that this course fulfilled a BoK requirement, but again, this course filled a BoK requirement for
at least 94 of the students. It is possible that students either did not understand the technicalities
of the course or their program or did not fully understand the question and did not choose all the
reasons that applied. See Table 4 for data by treatment condition.

Research Design
This mixed methods study addressed gamification components in an online class using a
Triangulation Research design (Creswell et al., 2003). This type of mixed methods design
utilizes both qualitative and quantitative data types concurrently, using one type as data to
support the other data type. This is helpful when the research questions call for different types of
data. It allows the researcher to simultaneously analyze quantitative results along with qualitative
57

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
findings to validate, compare, contrast, or expand the quantitative results (Creswell, 2003). In
this type of mixed methods design, the data have equal weighting and are mixed at the design
level. Data are collected concurrently rather than waiting and allowing one data type to influence
the design of the other data type. This provides the opportunity to analyze the data types
independently using the techniques best associated with each data type.
The Concurrent Triangulation Research mixed method design is the best choice for this
study because the data were collected and analyzed together. The quantitative data were given
priority in this study, with the qualitative data playing a secondary role to measure student
perceptions and enhance and/or explain the findings. The data sets were mixed during the design
phase of the study, analyzed independently, and merged during the interpretation phase of the
study.
As stated previously, data from regularly occurring practices within an online
Introductory Child Development course in the Early Childhood Education Online (ECE Online)
program were analyzed and interpreted to answer the research questions. Data collected in the
course included both quantitative and qualitative data.
Quantitative data included data from students in the form of a close-ended survey to
assess motivation and learning strategies. These data were collected in a set of 6 courses in the
program during Fall Semester 2015 to provide information to the program about student
motivation in courses. The motivation and learning strategies survey results from the Child
Development course were used to determine whether these influence student achievement
relative to the gamification component. Quantitative data in the form of student grades (quizzes,
assignments, final exam, and course grade) were collected to determine if the gamification
component had any effect on student achievement. Survey data was collected during the final
58

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
week of the course in which students answered close-ended questions about their experiences in
the course. All close-ended questions used four-point Likert scales.
Qualitative data were collected in the end-of-course survey in the form of open-ended
questions and comments about students’ experiences in the course. Students also completed a
course reflection at the end of the course, and this was used by the researcher to enhance the
understanding of gamification components relative to student achievement and student
experience.
Data Collection
As part of the course requirements, students completed a motivation and learning
strategies questionnaire (see Appendix), a course reflection, and an end of the course feedback
survey. These items were not unique to this course and were implemented in several other
courses to provide feedback to the instructors of the course and to the program.
Course introductions asking students to introduce themselves within the discussion board
provided demographic information for the students. Students completed the Motivated Strategies
for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, Mckeachie, 1993; Pintrich, Smith, Garcia,
& McKeachie, 1991) which assesses the motivational orientations and learning strategies for
college students (see Appendix). The survey contains 50 items on a close-ended questionnaire
with a scale of 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me). Thirty-one (31) of the items relate
to motivation and 19 of the items relate to learning strategies. To date, none of the gamification
research has used this validated instrument (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & Mckeachie, 1993) as a
covariate. Students also completed a reflection at the end of the course and an end-of-coursesurvey regarding their perceptions of the course and the gamification components included in its
delivery. Grade center data collected included final course grade, quiz grades, written assignment
59

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
grades, final exam grades, and quiz statistics including the number of attempts per quiz to
determine student achievement and student behavior in relation to the gamified components. All
data were obtained from the instructional system after final grades were issued to students. See
Table 5 for a list of all measures.

Data Analysis
This study sought to answer four specific questions regarding gamification components
in an online course. Data analyses for each question are presented below:
Research Question 1: How do specific gamification components affect student
achievement? Data on student achievement was collected, including grades for the following:
Check Your Knowledge quizzes, written homework assignments, written major papers, final
exam, and final course grade. Since the discussion board interactions were used for
attendance/participation grades, these were not used in the analysis. In addition, data on the
number of attempts on each quiz was collected.

60

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
To answer Research Question 1, a principal components analysis (PCA) was first run on
student achievement data consisting of 20 assignments in the Introductory Child Development
course: six quizzes, one final exam, three major written assignments, and ten written homework
assignments. The goal of the PCA was to review the correlations for the variables and look at
those that were most highly correlated with one another. In doing this, the PCA aims to reduce
the 20 individual components of the student achievement data into a smaller set of components,
or factors, which would account for the variance in the original set of student achievement data.
Once component loadings were established, a Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation was run to
determine the relationship between final course grade and the principal components identified as
part of the PCA analysis. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was run to determine the
effect of gamification component on student achievement scores as defined by the principal
components. A MANOVA was then run to determine the student achievement differences
among the Principal Components by gamification component. To further evaluate the differences,
a Pearson Correlation was run to evaluate the correlations to final grade using the categories
established in the syllabus. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was run to determine the
effect of gamification component on student achievement scores of the individual assignments.
Finally, a MANOVA was run on number of quiz attempts by gamification component to
establish if any differences existed.
Research Question 2: Is there a significant difference in achievement in extrinsically
motivated students versus intrinsically motivated students in a gamified online course? Data
collected for R2 included the Motivation and Learning Strategy Questionnaire results, and
assignment grades grouped on the principal components. To answer research question 2, a oneway ANOVA was run for each treatment condition to determine the effect of intrinsic versus

extrinsic motivation (independent variable) on student achievement scores as defined by the
principal components (dependent variable).
Research Question 3: What are student perceptions of the gamified components of
unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking in an online course? Data collected to address
Research question 3 included final course reflections, four-point Likert scale questions on an
end-of-course survey, and open-ended questions on an end-of-course survey. A one way analysis
of variance was run to compare the results of the Likert-scale questions on the end-of-course
survey by the treatment conditions.
To further analyze research question 3, qualitative data in the form of final course
reflections and open-ended comments and questions on the end-of-course survey were open
coded for themes which were then grouped into axial codes to determine student perceptions of
the gamified course. Twenty-five percent (25%) of the data were coded by another researcher for
reliability. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the codes in both data sets matched, with 100% of the
differences due to information that was missing a code by one researcher. Of the information that
was coded, there was no disagreement about which code exemplified the data. There were fifteen
instances that the second researcher coded that were missed by the primary researcher. Further
examination of these instances resulted in adding the appropriate codes to the data set before
analysis of the coding began. Of the remaining information, evaluation of the data coded was
deemed accurate and was used as originally coded with the addition of the 15 codes. Data were
triangulated by comparing end of course reflections interpretation with end of course survey
interpretation to verify that data sets were internally consistent within each section.
Research Question 4: How do student perceptions of a gamified course correlate with
data regarding student achievement? Data collected to address Research question 4 included
62

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
assignment grades grouped by principal component, final course reflections, and Likert-scale
questions and open-ended questions on the end-of-course survey. After both sets of data were
analyzed, they were merged and synthesized to determine how student perceptions of
gamification components relate to student achievement. The open codes and axial codes were
compared to student achievement data by treatment condition to determine what relationships
existed between the data.

Results
As stated previously, the purpose of this research study was to evaluate the three specific
gamification components of unlimited lives, level-locking, and badges in isolation to determine
which, if any, of these components affected student achievement in an online course. In addition,
the study evaluated whether there were significant differences in achievement in terms of
motivation level at the beginning of the course across the different gamification components.
Lastly, this study analyzed student perceptions of the gamification components and the online
course. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to investigate the following research
questions:
1. How do the specific gamification components of unlimited lives, badges, and levellocking affect student achievement?
2. Is there a significant difference in achievement in extrinsically motivated students
versus intrinsically motivated students in a gamified online course?
3. What are student perceptions of the gamified components of unlimited lives, badges,
and level-locking in an online course?

63

4. How do student perceptions of a gamified course correlate with data regarding
student achievement?
Research Question 1
To answer research question 1 (How do the specific components of unlimited lives,
badges, and level-locking affect student achievement?) a principal components analysis (PCA)
was run on the student achievement data. Then, a Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation was
run to establish the relationship between the final course grade and the components from the
PCA. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect of
gamification component on the principal components. A Pearson’s Correlation was then run on
the categories contained in the syllabus to further explain the trends from the PCA. Then, a
MANOVA was run on individual assignment grades. Finally, a MANOVA was run on final
course percentage. In addition, data was collected and analyzed regarding the total number of
attempts per quiz as well as the number of attempts after achieving 80%. A MANOVA was run
to determine if any significant differences existed.
Principal Components Analysis. A principal components analysis (PCA) was run on
student achievement data consisting of 20 assignments in the Introductory Child Development
course: six quizzes, one final exam, three major written assignments, and ten written homework
assignments. The aim of the PCA was to reduce the 20 individual components of the student
achievement data into a smaller set of components, or factors, which would account for the
majority of variance in the original set of student achievement data. The correlation matrix
revealed that 19 of the assignments had at least one correlation coefficient greater than 0.3. One
of the written homework assignments (WA), WA Observation Practice Homework, had a
correlation of less than 0.25 and will not be included in further analysis. See Table A1 in
64

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Appendix A for the correlation matrix. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling
adequacy was calculated for all variables with an overall score of .830 (classified as meritorious
on Kaiser’s classification of measure values, 1974) and all individual scores greater than 0.683.
One of the scores classified as marvelous, twelve of the scores classified as meritorious, four of
the scores classified as middling, and three of the scores classified as mediocre (Kaiser, 1974).
Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was statistically significant (p < .0005), indicating that the data was
likely a good fit for the PCA. See Tables A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A for specific scores.
PCA revealed five components with eigenvalues greater than one. These explained
35.6%, 12.6%, 7.8%, 6.3%, and 5.3% of the variance, respectively. Visual inspection of the
inflection point on the scree plot (see Figure 1) indicated that only two components should be
retained (Cattell, 1966). Inspection of the Rotated Component Matrix table (see Table 6)
confirmed the choice of the two-component criteria.

Figure 1. Scree plot depicting inflection points of PCA Analysis.
The two-component solution explained 48.2% of the total variance (see Table A4 in
Appendix A). A Varimax orthogonal rotation displayed “simple structure” (Thurstone, 1947).
The interpretation of the data was consistent with the categories of assignments upon which the
65

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
course was designed to measure, with strong loadings of tests and quizzes on Component 1 and
written assignments on Component 2. See Table 6 for component loadings and communalities of
the rotated solution.

A Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation was run to determine the relationship between
final course grade and the principal components determined by the PCA analysis. Preliminary
analysis showed the relationship to be linear with both variables as assessed through a scatterplot,
but not normally distributed as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p<.05). Since a Pearson’s
66

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
correlation is somewhat robust to normality deviations, the scatterplots were visually inspected
for outliers. The level-locking condition revealed no outliers for either principal component.
There were two outliers in the unlimited lives condition scatterplot for Principal Components 1
and 2. Inspection of the data revealed that both of these outliers were missing multiple
assignments in the course (missing 30% and 45% of the total assignments for the course,
respectively) but did not qualify for a UW by department rules. The decision was made to
remove these cases from the data set for further analyses since the “0” achievement scores were a
function of participation rather than actual achievement. There were also two outliers in the
badges condition which were consistent across both principal components. These two students
also did not qualify for a UW score according to university policy, but the students did not
submit 20% of the required assignments for the course. Therefore, both students were removed
from further analyses. In all, four outliers were removed from analysis: two from unlimited lives
and two from badges.
In the unlimited lives condition, student achievement in the form of final grades had a
strong correlation, r(34) = .799, p < .0005, with Principal Component 1 explaining 64% of the
variation in final course grade, and there was a strong correlation, r(34) = .901, p<.0005, with
Principal Component 2 explaining 81% of the variation in final course grade. In the Level
Locking condition, there was a strong correlation, r(36) = .733, p < .0005, with Principal
Component 1 explaining 54% of the variation in final course grade, and there was a strong
correlation, r(34) = .940, p<.0005, with Principal Component 2 explaining 88% of the variation
in final course grade. In the badges condition, there was a strong correlation, r(32) = . 626, p
< .0005, with Principal Component 1 explaining 39% of the variation in final course grade, and
there was a strong correlation, r(30) = .733, p<.0005, with Principal Component 2 explaining
67

MANOVA for Effect of Gamification Component. A one-way multivariate analysis of
variance was run to determine the effect of gamification component on student achievement
scores as defined by the principal components from the PCA (Research question 1). Principal
Component 1 was comprised of quizzes (6) and the final exam (1), and Principal Component 2
was comprised of the written assignments which included three major papers and 9 written
homework assignments. Students were in three different gamification components: unlimited
lives, level-locking, and badges. There were significant differences between the level-locking
and unlimited lives sections for Principal Component 2, with level-locking scoring significantly
lower (p = .004). No other significant differences were found.
Preliminary assumption checking revealed that there were no univariate outliers for
Principal Components 1 or 2 for the level-locking condition or the badges condition as assessed
by inspection of a boxplot (p > .05). There was one univariate outlier on Principal Component 1
and one outlier on Principal Component 2 for the unlimited lives condition, as assessed by
inspection of a boxplot (p < .05). Data were checked for data entry errors and measurement
errors and were found to be accurate. Inspection of the outlier cases revealed that these students
turned in most or all assignments but scored poorly. This did not appear to be a good reason for
removing them from the analysis, therefore they were left in for all future analyses (see Figure 2
for boxplot). There were no multivariate outliers in the data as evidenced by Mahalanobis
68

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
distance (critical z score < 13.82 with 2 degrees of freedom and p < .001). A Shapiro-Wilk test
was run for each level of the independent variable, gamification component, and for both
dependent variables (Principal Component 1 and Principal Component 2) to test for normality
(see Table 8). The assumption of normality was violated on all dependent variables with the
exception of Principal Component 2 in the badges condition. This violation of normality is
acceptable in this case because students were able to take all of the assessments/assignments
(excluding the final exam) more than once to obtain their desired score, therefore normality was
not expected. There was no multicollinearity as assessed by Pearson correlation (r = .347, p
< .001). There were positive linear relationships between the Principal Components for each
gamification component as indicated in quadrants one and three of the scatterplots. There was no
homogeneity of variance-co-variances matrices as indicated by Box’s M test (p < .001) and
confirmed by Levene’s Test of Homogeneity of Variance (p = .007 for Principal Component 1
and p = .005 for Principal Component 2. This was expected and acceptable since the n’s for each
group are approximately the same and because the assignments for the course were weighted for
the final grade.

A MANOVA was run to determine the student achievement differences among the
Principal Components by gamification component. On Principal Component 1, students in the
level-locking section scored higher than students in the unlimited lives section or badges section
(n = 36, M = .9238, SD = .044, n = 34, M = .9124, SD = .083, and n = 32, M = .8869, SD = .093,
respectively). On Principal Component 2, students in the unlimited lives section scored higher
than the badges section or the level-locking section (n = 34, M = .9182, SD = .069, n = 32, M
= .9003, SD = .066, and n = 36, M = .8542, SD = .103, respectively). The differences between
the gamification components on the combined dependent variables was statistically significant,
F(4,196) = 5.355, p <.0005; Wilk's Λ = 0.813, partial η2 = .099. Tukey post-hoc tests showed no
significant differences between the sections on Principal Component 1. However, the levellocking section scored significantly lower on Principal Component 2 than students in the
unlimited lives section (p = .004), but there were not statistical differences between the badges
section and the level-locking section (p = .059) or unlimited lives and badges sections (p = .649).

Interesting Trends for Research Question 1. It should be noted that an interesting trend
occurred regarding the correlations. In Principal Component 1, the unlimited lives section
explained a much larger portion of the variance in final grade (r = .799, 64%) than either the
level-locking section (r = .733, 54%) or the badges section (r = .626, 39%). In Principal
Component 2, the level-locking (r = .940, 88%) and unlimited lives (r = .901, 81%) sections
explained a much larger portion of the variance in final grade than the badges condition (r = .733,
54%). To further evaluate the differences, a Pearson Correlation was run to evaluate the
correlations to final grade using the categories established in the syllabus.
Examination of the syllabus categories revealed similar trends and further explanation.
Final grade in the syllabus was calculated as 10% final exam, 15% quizzes, 25% written
homework, and 30% major written papers. The remaining 20% of the final grade was based on
participation in the discussion boards. In the unlimited lives condition, Principal Component 2
(consisting of the written portion of assignments) had a stronger correlation to final grade than
Principal Component 1 (consisting of the quizzes/tests). Using the syllabus categories, the
following correlations were discovered (presented in order of variance, highest to lowest):
Written Homework Assignments, r(34) = .858, p < .0005, explaining 74% of the variance in final
course grade, Major Written Papers, r(34) = .759, p < .0005, explaining 58% of the variance in
final course grade, Quizzes, r(34) = .758, p < .0005, explaining 57% of the variance, and finally
Final Exam, r(34) = .533, p = .001, explaining 28% of the variance. The level-locking condition
71

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
displayed similar results in terms of the groupings of Principal Components, though the order
within each component was opposite of the unlimited lives condition. Using the syllabus
categories, the following correlations were discovered (presented in order of variance, highest to
lowest): Major Written Papers, r(36) = .908, p < .0005, explaining 82% of the variance in final
course grade, Written Homework Assignments, r(36) = .849, p < .0005, explaining 74% of the
variance in final course grade, Final Exam, r(36) = .701, p < .0005, explaining 49% of the
variance, and finally Quizzes, r(36) = .672, p < .0005, explaining 45% of the variance. The
badges condition followed this same pattern of the grouping the Principal Components together,
with Written Homework Assignments and Major Written Papers carrying virtually the same
amount of variance. In the badges condition, the correlations were: Major Written Papers, r(32)
= .719, p < .0005, explaining 52% of the variance in final course grade, Written Homework
Assignments, r(32) = .713, p < .0005, explaining 51% of the variance in final course grade, Final
Exam, r(32) = .659, p < .0005, explaining 43% of the variance, and finally Quizzes, r(32) = .592,
p < .0005, explaining 35% of the variance. (See Table 10 for correlation comparison across
sections).

MANOVA for Effect on Individual Assignments. A one-way multivariate analysis of
variance was run to determine the effect of gamification component on student achievement
scores (Research question 1). Nineteen (19) measures of student achievement were assessed:
72

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
seven quizzes, three major written papers, eight homework assignments, and one final exam.
Students were in three different gamification components: unlimited lives, level-locking, and
badges. Preliminary assumption checking (See Appendix B, Figures B1 – B19 for boxplots)
revealed that there were no univariate outliers in the data as assessed by inspection of a boxplot
(p > .05) for Quiz 11 in all conditions. In addition, no univariate outliers were discovered for the
written homework assignment on Infant Cognitive Development for the unlimited lives condition.
In the level-locking condition, none of the quizzes or final exam had univariate outliers. In the
badges condition, the following had no univariate outliers: Quiz 3, Quiz 6, Quiz 13, Major
Written Paper on Physical and Motor Development, Major Written Paper on Cognitive and
Language Development, Written Homework assignment for Parent Newsletter, and Written
homework assignment on Infant Cognitive Development. Univariate outliers were discovered in
all other dependent variables (p < .05). Multivariate outliers were assessed with Mahalanobis
distance (p > .001). Ninety-three (93) of the cases had multivariate outliers as evidenced by a
higher Mahalanobis score than the critical z score of 7.633 with 19 degrees of freedom and p
< .001. There was not enough information about individual data points to make the decision to
not include them in analyses, and since the gamification component may have had an effect on
these outlier scores, the decision was made to retain all data points including outliers. A ShapiroWilk test was run for each level of the independent variable, gamification component, and for all
dependent variables to test for normality (see Table B1 in Appendix B). The assumption of
normality was violated on all dependent variables with the exception of Quiz #6 (week 11) in the
level-locking condition. This violation of normality is acceptable in this case because students
were able to take all of the assessments/assignments (excluding the final exam) more than once
to obtain their desired score, therefore normality was not expected. There was no
73

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
multicollinearity as assessed by Pearson correlation (see Table B2 in Appendix B). There were
positive linear relationships between the grades for each gamification component as indicated in
quadrants one and three of the scatterplots. There was no homogeneity of variance-covariances
matrices as indicated by Box’s M test (p < .000). Levene’s Test of Homogeneity of Variance
further indicated that ten (10) of the 19 assignments had heterogeneous variances (see Table B3
in Appendix B). This was expected and acceptable since the n’s for each group are
approximately the same and because the assignments for the course were weighted for the final
grade.
The differences between the gamification components on the combined dependent
variables was statistically significant, F(38,162) = 1.678, p = .014; Wilk's Λ = 0.515, partial
η2 = .282. Tukey post-hoc tests showed that students in the badges section scored significantly
lower (p = .026) on Quiz #6 (week 11) (n = 32, M = .8617, SD = .1161) than students in the
level-locking section (n = 36, M = .9188, SD = .0578) but there were not statistical differences
between the badges section (n = 32, M = .8617, SD = .1161) and the unlimited lives section (n =
34, M = .8949, SD = .0876) (p = .291) or unlimited lives (n = 34, M = .8949, SD = .0876) and
level-locking sections (n = 36, M = .9188, SD = .0578) (p = .397). Students in the level-locking
condition (n = 36, M = .8324, SD = .2197) scored significantly lower on Major Written Paper #2:
Cognitive and Language Development than students in the badges (n = 32, M = .9193, SD

respectively) but there were not statistical differences between the badges (n = 32, M = .9193,
SD = .0737) or unlimited lives (n = 34, M = .9363, SD = .0561) conditions (p = .876). Students
in the level-locking condition (n = 36, M = .7701, SD = .2855) scored significantly lower on

= .9307, SD = .0773) or unlimited lives (n = 34, M = .9258, SD = .0936) conditions (p = .994).
Students in the level-locking section (n = 36, M = .9587, SD = .0431) scored significantly lower
on Homework #1: Reflection on the Influences of Development assignment than students from
the unlimited lives section (n = 34, M = .9876, SD = .0274) and the badges condition (n = 32, M

Interesting Trends. An investigation of the mean scores of each assignment by treatment
condition revealed an interesting trend. The unlimited lives condition never had the lowest mean
for any of the assignments. For quizzes and tests, badges always had the lowest mean, and levellocking had the highest mean for all but two quizzes. For the written homework assignments,
level-locking never had the highest mean, and had the lowest mean for all except two of the
homework assignments. For major written assignments, level-locking always had the lowest
mean and continued to decline as the course progressed. See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for trends.

Final Course Grade. A passing grade for this Introductory Child Development course is
74% or better. Of the 102 students who completed the course and are included in the analysis,
100 students passed the course (see Table 12). None of the students received a grade of less than
C-. However, the four students who were removed as outliers did receive a grade of lower than
C- and were equally distributed between the unlimited lives section and the badges section. A
one-way ANOVA was run to determine if there were any significant differences in final grade
between the three treatment conditions. The mean scores increased from level-locking (n = 36, M
= .8836, SD = .08) to badges (n = 32, M = .9126, SD = .05) to unlimited lives (n = 34, M = .9246,
SD = .06) conditions, in that order. Final course grade was statistically different for the groups
(F(2, 99) = 3.540, p = .033). Tukey post hoc analysis revealed that the mean increase from the
level-locking condition to the unlimited lives condition, a mean increase of .0411, 95% CI
[.0032, .0789], was statistically significant (p = .03) while the increase from level-locking to
badges (mean increase of .0290, 95% CI [-.0674, .0094], p = .176) and badges to unlimited lives

(mean increase of .0120, 95% CI [-.0510, .0269], p = .742) was not statistically different. See

Quiz Attempts. A one way MANOVA was run to determine if differences existed
among the number of total attempts on quizzes by gamification component. The differences
between the gamification components on the combined dependent variables was not statistically
significant, F(14,182) = 1.039, p <.417; Wilk's Λ = 0.857, partial η2 = .074. Tukey post-hoc tests
showed no significant differences between sections for Quizzes 1 (week 1), 2 (week 3), 3 (week
5), 4 (week 6), 6 (week 11), or 7 (week 13). However, for quiz 5 (week 8) the students in the
level-locking section (n = 36, M = 2.89, SD = 2.180) had significantly more attempts than
79

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
unlimited lives. Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that differences were significant between levellocking and unlimited lives sections (p = .019) but not between unlimited lives and badges (p
= .495) or badges and level-locking (p = .257).
A one way MANOVA was run to determine if differences existed between the sections
among the number of students who continued to attempt quizzes after a score of 80% was
reached on the quiz. The differences between the gamification components on the combined
dependent variables was not statistically significant, F(14,182) = 2.027, p <.018; Wilk's Λ = 0.748,
partial η2 = .135. Tukey post-hoc tests showed no significant differences between sections for
Quizzes 1 (week 1), 2, (week 3), 3 (week 5), 4 (week 6), 5 (week 8), or 6 (week 11). However,
for quiz 7 (week 13), more students in the level-locking section (n = 36, M = .57, SD = 0.502)
continued to attempt the quiz than students in the unlimited lives section (n = 34, M = .42, SD =
0.502) or the badges section (n = 32, M = .19, SD = 0.397). Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that
differences were significant between level-locking and badges sections (p = .003) but not
between unlimited lives and badges (p = .111) or unlimited lives and level-locking (p = .405).
Interesting Trends. When looking at the total number of attempts on quizzes per section,
the total number of attempts in the unlimited lives section continued to decline throughout the
semester from Quiz 1 through Quiz 6 (week 11), but then rose again on the last quiz (week 13).
There was no specific pattern for the level-locking section or the badges section. The number of
attempts in the level-locking section declined steadily from Quiz 1 through Quiz 4 (week 6), then
rose for Quiz 5 (week 8), declined for quiz 6 (week 11), and rose again for quiz 7 (week 13). The
number of attempts in the badges section declined from Quiz 1 to Quiz 3 (week 5), rose slightly
for Quiz 4 (week 6) and again for Quiz 5 (week 8), declined for Quiz 6 (week 11), then rose
again for the last quiz (week 13). See Figure 6 for a graph depicting the results. When looking at
80

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
the number of students who continued to take the quiz after reaching a score of 80%, a
significant drop occurred in the unlimited lives section for Quizzes 5 and 6 (weeks 8 and 11). In
the level locking section, only 2 students continued to take the first quiz after reaching 80%, but
that number greatly increased and remained somewhat steady until Quiz 6 (week 11) when it
dropped greatly and then rebounded for the last quiz. Students in the badges section remained
somewhat consistent through the beginning and middle of the course, but then the number of
students dropped by about half for the last two quizzes (See Figure 7).

Badges. The total number of badges earned for each quiz remained somewhat consistent
with a low of 24 badges for quiz 6 (week 11) and a high of 32 for quiz 3 (week 5). The number
of badges earned started to decline slightly after Quiz #4 (Week 6), which coincided with when
the first major paper was due (Week 7). There were 16 students who earned all (7) of the badges.
Of the eight students who earned six of the seven available badges, two students missed the first
badge but then earned the rest, and six students earned the badges at the beginning but then
missed one of the later badges. The remaining students had no clear pattern.
As previously reported, the mean quiz grades were lower than the other two sections, but
that was not true for the written assignments. There was no clear pattern of grades on the written
assignments. Students in the badges section had the lowest mean score on two of the homework
assignments. They also had the highest mean score for two of the homework assignments. The
students in the badges section had the highest score on two of the three major written papers.

Research Question 2
To answer research question 2, is there a significant difference in achievement in
extrinsically motivated students versus intrinsically motivated students in a gamified online
course, students were asked to complete the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire
(MSLQ, See Appendix C for questions and Table C1 in Appendix C for scoring guide) (Pintrich
83

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
& Degroot, 1991; Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & Mckeachie, 1993). The MSLQ is a questionnaire
that measures college students’ motivational orientations and the learning strategies that they use
during a college course. It contains 31 items in the motivation section that assess goals and value
beliefs for a course. It also contains a learning strategies section which contains 31 items about
cognitive and metacognitive strategies and 19 items about managing resources. The entire 81item survey was given during week 2 of the course to ensure that validity was maintained (see
appendix questions), though only the motivation results are reported here. The number of
students who completed the survey included 31 students in the unlimited lives section (out of 34),
35 students in the level-locking section (out of 36), and 29 students in the badges section (out of
32) for a total of 95 out of 102 students.
Effect of Motivation on Achievement. To answer research question 2, the results of the
MLSQ were computed. Using the scoring manual that accompanied the MLSQ, averages were
determined for the six motivation components, and a final motivation score was obtained by
averaging those six components. Since each participant had a slightly different average, it was
not possible to run a MANOVA with these numbers; therefore a motivation ranking system was
designed. A motivation rank was assigned to each participant based on their motivation average,
with a score between 6.0 and 6.99 resulting in a rank of 6, a score between 5.0 and 5.99 resulting
in a rank of 5, and so on. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was then run to determine
the effect of the level of motivation (independent variable) on student achievement scores as
defined by Principal Components 1 and 2 (dependent variable) for each treatment condition.
There were no significant differences in the unlimited lives condition between motivation rank
on the combined dependent variables, F(6,52) = 2.039, p = .077; Wilk's Λ = 0.655, partial
η2 = .190. Overall, students who scored higher in Motivation also had a higher mean for both
84

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Principal Components. There were no significant differences in the level-locking condition
between motivation rank on the combined dependent variables, F(6,60) = .901, p = .500; Wilk's Λ
= 0.841, partial η2 = .083. There did not appear to be a specific trend regarding motivation and
achievement on the principal components for the level-locking Condition. There were no
significant differences in the badges condition between motivation rank on the combined
dependent variables, F(4,50) = .452, p = .770; Wilk's Λ = 0.931, partial η2 = .035. Inspection of
the means revealed no specific pattern on Principal Component 1, but on Principal Component 2
as motivation score increased, the mean for Principal Component 2 decreased.
Research Question 3
Research question 3 asked what student perceptions of the gamified components of
unlimited lives, badges, and level-locking in an online course were. To answer this research
question, all groups were asked open-ended questions and Likert-scale questions on an end-ofcourse evaluation survey during the last week of the course. A one way analysis of variance was
run on the Likert scale questions to compare the treatment conditions. The qualitative data was
open coded, resulting in 27 open codes. These were then grouped into five axial codes. The
specific questions asked are listed first, followed by a discussion of the open and axial codes, and
then assumption testing for the ANOVA. Individual ANOVA results for the Likert scale
questions are presented by theme along with the qualitative data. Themes related specifically to
the gamification components are presented first, and a general discussion of the remainder of the
themes follows.
Open ended questions. Open-ended questions asked of students on the survey consisted
of the following:

85

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
All students:


The things I liked best about how my instructor taught this course are:



Do you feel supported as a student in learning the content for this course? Why or
why not?



I would also like to say:

Level-locking students:


This course is set up with a focus on content mastery which means that you
must score 80% on quizzes or you must re-take them. What are your thoughts
on this format?

Badges students:


You have the opportunity to earn achievements in this course. Do these
motivate you to master the content and take the quizzes until you earn the
required score to earn the achievement?

Students also completed a final course reflection with open ended questions. The assignment
asked students to reflect on the following questions:


What have you learned this semester? How have your viewpoints and/or teaching
practices changed?



What questions about development still exist for you? What would you like to learn
more about?



What would you like your instructor to know about your experience in this course?

Likert scale questions. Likert scale questions were presented on a four-point scale with
categories of strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. Students were asked to
86

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
choose rating that most resembled their opinion of the statement. Six questions were asked of all
students, the level-locking group was asked two additional questions, and the badges group was
asked three additional questions. The additional questions asked of students on the survey
included the following:
All students:


I liked being able to take the quizzes more than once.



I took the quizzes more than once because I wanted a better grade.



I took the quizzes more than once because I wanted to make sure I understood the
content.



Taking the quizzes more than once helped me master the content of the class.



I felt more supported as a learner because I was able to take the quizzes more than
once.



I think more classes should offer multiple attempts on quizzes.

Level-locking students:


Being forced to score at least 80% on the quizzes in order to move forward in the
course helped me to learn the content.



I liked the fact that I had to score 80% on the quizzes to move forward and think
more classes should follow this format.

Badges students:


I took the quizzes more than once because I wanted to earn the achievement.



The achievements motivated me to earn a higher score on the quizzes, and thus
helped me learn the content.

87

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE


follow this format.

Open and axial codes. Table 15 presents the results of the open codes and axial codes (with
examples) that emerged from the analysis of the student reflections and end of course survey
pertaining to perceptions of the online course apart from the gamification component. Twentyseven (27) open codes emerged from the analysis with those codes grouping into five axial codes
of Gamification Component, General Student Experience, Course Structure Not Related to
Gamification, Faculty Presence, and Course Content Not Related to Gamification. General
Student Experience included concepts around learning, whether they had a positive, negative, or
mixed experience, confidence, motivation, or pressure. The category of course structure related
to comments organization of the course that did not specifically relate to the gamification
component, student perceptions of online courses, and the flexibility of the course. The Faculty
Presence category included instruction, communication, assignment feedback, whether faculty
were seen as caring or helpful, and grading practices. The Course Content Not Related to
Gamification category included comments made around the child development content, whether
students found the content useful or applicable in their current jobs, wanting to know more about
a specific concept, changed viewpoints or practices as a result of the course, comments about
specific assignments that didn’t specifically address a gamification component, workload of the
course, and having content presented in multiple modes (i.e., readings and videos).

Assumption testing. The six Likert-scale questions listed above for all students were
asked in an end-of-course survey. Visual inspection of the data through a box plot revealed
outliers in most of the questions for most of the treatment conditions (see Figures D1 – D6 in
Appendix D). No outliers were present in the following:


All: Took Quizzes to Understand Content



Badges section: Liked Multiple Attempts, Taking Quizzes Helped Me Master Content



Level-locking section: Took Quizzes for Better Grades
90

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Visual inspection of the boxplots revealed that outliers existed whenever there was no span of
the box (i.e., all scored clustered around the rating of 4). Since these outliers were not due to data
entry errors or measurement errors, they represent genuine values within the data set and were
kept for analysis. A Shapiro-Wilk test was run for each level of the independent variable,
gamification component, and for the dependent variables regarding student perceptions of the
course. The assumption of normality was violated on all dependent variables (See Table D1 in
Appendix D). Normality was not expected on the answers to these questions, therefore the
violation of normality is acceptable in this case. The assumption of homogeneity of variances
was violated for four of the six questions (liked multiple attempts, took quizzes for better grade,
felt more supported because of multiple attempts, and more classes should offer multiple
attempts), as assessed by Levene's test for equality of variances (p = .014, p < .001, p < .001, p
= .001, respectively). Results of the one-way ANOVA are presented below by theme.
Perceptions of the Gamification Component. In the gamified course sections, students
were able to take quizzes as many times as they desired. Although it was required in the levellocking section to take the quizzes until a score of 80% was reached, students could still take the
quizzes to earn a higher grade after reaching the 80% mark. In addition, students were able to redo any written assignment in the course if they earned a score less than 75%. Though students
often did not differentiate between re-doing quizzes or assignments, the idea of multiple attempts
was a common element through all of the courses in both the final course reflection and the endof-course survey, even when they were not asked to specifically comment on that element.
Students were asked what they liked best about the way their instructor taught the course. A total
of 18 (18%) students out of 100 students that answered the question specifically mentioned the
multiple attempts on quizzes or assignments (four out of 33 students in the unlimited lives
91

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
section (12%), seven out of 35 (20%) in the level locking section, and seven out of 32 (22%) in
the badges section). For all three groups, multiple attempts ranked third in terms of the number
of students that mentioned this aspect in the question. Students commented that what they liked
best about the course was
“the ability to retake quizzes so that I could go back and relearn important topics
covered,”
“The way quizzes were. The best way to understand and retain knowledge is to see
information over and over again. After taking a quiz multiple times I felt like I truly knew
what we were supposed to know,” and
“I liked that we were given multiple attempts on the check your knowledge quizzes
because it allowed me to comprehend the material better than if I were given only one
chance.”
A small percentage of students cited the gamification component as a way that they felt
supported in learning the content of the course. Ten students (out of 100 students that answered
the question, 10%) cited multiple attempts as one of the ways that they felt supported in learning
the content for the course (three in unlimited lives, 9%, tied with two other themes for second
place ranking, four in level-locking, 11%, tied with two other themes for second place ranking,
and three in badges, 9%, tied with one other theme for third place ranking). An example of a
comment from the feeling supported question is,
“She has made me feel very supported and always gives positive feedback/second
chances. She wishes for everyone to learn not fail.”

92

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Students were also asked to rate their agreement to the statement: I feel more supported as a
result of being able to take quizzes more than once (Likert scale of 1, Strongly Disagree, to 4,
Strongly Agree, see Table 16 for raw data and percentages for all categories). Ninety-four
percent (94%, 33 out of 36 students) of students in the level-locking section strongly agreed with
this statement, compared with 84% of students (27 out of 32) in the badges section and 76% of
students (25 out of 33) in the unlimited lives section. The scores increased from unlimited lives
(n = 33, M = 3.76 out of 4, SD = .44), to badges (n = 32, M = 3.84 out of 4, SD = .37), to levellocking (n = 35, M = 3.94 out of 4, SD = .24) conditions, in that order. There were no significant
differences between the groups, Welch’s F(2, 58.559) = .2.631, p = .081. This supports the open
ended response to the question in which unlimited lives and badges sections cited multiple
attempts less often than the level-locking section.

A final question on the survey provided students with the opportunity to respond to the
statement, “I would also like to say.” Fifty-three students answered this question. Seven of these
students, or 13%, cited the multiple attempts on quizzes as something else they wanted to say
about the course in the final open-ended question on the survey (three out of 15 in unlimited
lives, 20%; one out of 16 in level-locking, 6%; and three out of 22 in badges, 14%). One student
said,
93

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
“It made the course less stressful knowing I could redo the quizzes if I didn’t receive the
grade I wanted.”
In the final course reflection, 18 students out of the 97 that completed the assignment
commented on the multiple attempts aspect of the course, including four students in the
unlimited lives conditions (out of 32, 12.5%), six students in the level-locking condition (out of
34, 18%), and seven students in the badges condition (out of 31, 23%). In the unlimited lives
condition, one student stated,
“I really like how there was an unlimited attempts on the check your knowledge quizzes
which made it a little less pressure and slightly less overwhelming if one round I didn’t
do so good.”
In the level-locking section, student comments included quotes such as,
“Taking the quizzes more than once to receive a better grade made me learn the material
much better.”
Three of these students specifically mentioned the level-locking component, including the
following:
“The one other piece of information that I would like to share is how much knowledge
that I have picked up by simply taking a quiz multiple times in order to reach a certain
percentage.”
“One of my favorite things about the course was that we had to receive a certain grade
on a quiz in order to unlock the next week’s information and homework. I was very
nervous about taking online courses because I was afraid I wouldn’t learn the same;

94

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
however, this strategy allowed me to make sure I have learned the material before I move
on.”
In the badges, one student commented,
“I really liked how the quizzes were set up! I liked that I could go in take it and then keep
taking it until I was able to get them right. Because I was going back for a couple
questions and then it just drilled the other ones into my brain. I don’t do well on test I
freeze up especially if they are timed. I may know it but just get flustered but I really liked
the way they were set up. I am hoping that I run into some other classes like that because
that really helped me learn the material.”
Only one student commented on the badges aspect in the final course reflection, saying,
“Having multiple attempts on the quizzes and the achievements helped me stay motivated
throughout the semester. The quizzes were more about comprehension of material rather
than just regurgitating facts.”
Related to the idea of multiple attempts was the idea of mastery over grades. This was a
concept explained to students in the first week of the course. The statements differed slightly
based on the gamification component in the section. In the first announcement, the following
statement was displayed in the sections:
Unlimited lives: To help motivate you to do well and master the content in the course,
you will be able to take the quizzes or do the assignments as often as needed to earn the
grade you desire. The idea is to take the pressure off and allow you to concentrate on
content rather than grades.

95

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Level-locking: To help motivate you to do well and master the content in the course, you
will not be able to unlock content for the following week until you earn at least 80% on
the check your knowledge quizzes. Not every week has a quiz....there are 7 quizzes in all.
You will be able to take the quizzes or do the assignments as often as needed to earn the
required 80%. The idea is to take the pressure off and allow you to concentrate on content
rather than grades.
Badges: To help motivate you to do well and master the content in the course, I've
instituted something fun called Achievements. You can earn an achievement on your
check your knowledge quizzes by earning 80% or more. You can find the achievements
you've earned as well as the achievements that are available to earn in the "My
Achievements" section of your course menu. Earn all the achievements this term and
you'll be able to print out a certificate of achievement to take with you at the end of the
term! You will be able to take the quizzes or do the assignments as often as needed to
earn the required 80% to earn the achievement. The idea is to take the pressure off and
allow you to concentrate on content rather than grades.
Several students (eight students out of 97, 8%) mentioned this concept of mastery over grades in
their final course reflection. Three students in the unlimited lives section (out of 32, 9%)
commented, and comments included,
“I liked how your motive was to help us students learn the course material, rather than to
just grade us on our mistakes without giving any second chances.”
Three students in the level-locking condition (out of 34, 9%) commented, with one saying,
“I also loved that this course was based off of our own knowledge of the content rather
than based off of just quizzes and test scores. This to me is exactly what a class should be
96

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
like. I learned so much more not having to worry about my grades. I could focus solely
on the content being taught at all times.”
Two students commented on this facet in the badges course (out of 31, 6%), with one student
saying,
“I liked the opportunity to retake tests in order to master the material. No other teacher
allows that, so I thought it was very cool how you noticed that it was important to
actually understand the material rather than just getting a grade and moving on.”
Though only a few students mentioned this concept in other places, it did appear several times in
low percentages. The concept was mentioned in the “what I liked best” question by two students
(one in level-locking (3%) and one in badges (3%), and one student (out of 32, 3%) mentioned it
in “feeling supported” question. Related to this concept, two students mentioned how the quizzes
took the pressure off in the “What I liked best” question (one out of 33 in unlimited lives, 3%
and one out of 32 in badges, 3%), four students mentioned it in the “I’d also like to say” question
(one student in level-locking out of 16, 6%; two students in badges out of 22, 9%), and one
student in in badges (out of 32, 3%) on the “feeling supported” question.
The quantitative data expands on this in an attempt to determine if mastery or grades was
the motivating factor by asking specifically for students to rate their agreement with the
statements, “I took the quizzes more than once because I wanted a better grade” and “I took the
quizzes more than once because I wanted to make sure I understood the content” (see Table 17
for raw data and percentages for each category). Results suggest that while both choices may
have been a motivating factor, grades received a higher percentage of responses. In the unlimited
lives section, 32 out of 33 students, or 97%, strongly agreed that grades were the reason, while
only 24 (73%) strongly agreed that they wanted to understand the content. In the badges section,
97

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
27 out of 32 students, or 84%, strongly agreed that grades were the reason, while only 18 (56%)
strongly agreed that they wanted to understand the content. In the level-locking section, 25 out of
36 students, or 69%, strongly agreed that grades were the reason, while only 21 (58%) strongly
agreed that they wanted to understand the content. When asked if they took the quizzes more
than once because they wanted a better grade, the mean scores increased from level-locking (n =
36, M = 3.61 out of 4, SD = .69) to badges (n = 32, M = 3.81 out of 4, SD = .47) to unlimited
lives (n = 33, M = 3.94 out of 4, SD = .35) conditions, in that order. Taking the quizzes more
than once to score a better grade was statistically different for the groups, Welch’s F(2, 62.292) =
3.325, p = .042. Games-Howell post hoc analysis revealed that the mean increase from the levellocking condition to the unlimited lives condition, a mean increase of .33, 95% CI [.03, .63], was
statistically significant (p = .030) while the increase from level-locking to badges (mean increase
of .20, 95% CI [-.10, .51], p = .263) and badges to unlimited lives (mean increase of .13, 95% CI
[-.19, .44], p = .598) was not statistically different. When asked if they took the quizzes more
than once because they wanted to make sure they understood the content, badges and levellocking had the same mean score, (badges (n = 32), M = 3.47 out of 4, SD = .67) and levellocking (n = 36, M = 3.47 out of 4, SD = .74)). The mean scores increased from badges and
level-locking to unlimited lives (n = 33, M = 3.64, SD = .65) conditions, in that order. There
were no significant differences between the groups, Welch’s F(2, 65.229) = .675, p = .513. The
badges group was also asked if they took the quizzes more than once because they wanted to
earn the achievement. Out of the 32 responses, 17 (53%) strongly agreed with the statement, 7
(22%) agreed, 5 (16%) disagreed, and 3 (9%) strongly disagreed. Only one student commented
on the achievements in any of the open-ended responses (cited previously in regards to unlimited
attempts).

The previous questions sought to understand why students were taking the quizzes more
than once. To determine if the quizzes helped students learn the content, students were asked to
rate their agreement with the statement, “Taking the quizzes more than once helped me master
the content of the class” (see Table 18). The percentages for students who strongly agreed with
the statement increased from badges (24 out of 32, 75%) to unlimited lives (25 out of 33 students,
76%) to level-locking (31 out of 36 students, 86%). The percentages for students who agreed
with the statement increased from level-locking (4 out of 36 students, 11%, to unlimited lives (6
out of 33 students, 18%) to badges (7 out of 32 students, 22%). Two students (out of 33, 6%)
disagreed with the statement in unlimited lives, and 1 student each disagreed with the statement
in level-locking and badges (1 out of 36, 3%, 1 out of 32, 3%, respectively). None of the students
in any of the sections strongly disagreed with the statement. The mean scores on this response
increased from unlimited lives (n = 33, M = 3.70 out of 4, SD = .59) to badges (n = 32, M = 3.72
out of 4, SD = .52), to Level Locking (n = 36, M = 3.83 out of 4, SD = .45) conditions, in that

When asked if they liked the ability to take the quizzes more than once, 94% of students
in the unlimited lives section (31 out of 33), 97% of students in the level-locking section (35 out
of 36), and 100% of students in the badges section (32 out of 32) strongly agreed with the
statement (see Table 19). The mean scores increased from unlimited lives (n = 33, M = 3.94 out
of 4, SD = .24), to level-locking (n = 36, M = 3.97 out of 4, SD = .17) to badges (n = 32, M = 4.0
out of 4, SD = .00) conditions, in that order. Robust tests of equality of means could not be
performed for this measure since there was no variance in the badges group. When asked if they
thought more classes should offer unlimited attempts on quizzes, 88% of students in the
unlimited lives section (29 out of 33), 97% of students in both the level-locking section (35 out
of 36), and badges section (31 out of 32) strongly agreed with the statement (see table 19). The
mean scores increased from unlimited lives (n = 33, M = 3.88 out of 4, SD = .33), to badges (n =

The level-locking and badges groups were asked two additional questions each regarding
whether they liked the gamification component in their class and whether the gamification
component helped them learn the content (see Table 20 for raw data and percentages). When the
level-locking group and the badges group were asked if they liked the gamification component
and thought more classes should have it, 53% of students in the badges section strongly agreed
(17 out of 32) compared to 83% of students in the level-locking section (30 out of 36). The levellocking section (n = 36, M = 3.81 out of 4, SD = .47) scored higher than the badges section (n =
32, M = 3.34 out of 4, SD = .87), and this difference between the groups was significant,
Welch’s F(1, 46.383) = 7.237, p = .010. When the level-locking group and the badges group
were asked if the gamification component helped them learn the content of the course, 53% of
students in the badges section strongly agreed (17 out of 32) compared to 92% of students in the
level-locking section (33 out of 36). The level-locking group (n = 36, M = 3.92 out of 4, SD
= .28) scored higher than the badges group (n = 32, M = 3.16 out of 4, SD = 1.08), and this
difference between the groups was significant, Welch’s F(1, 34.707) = 14.944, p < .0005.

Summary of Gamification Perceptions. In terms of the overall perception on the
multiple attempts aspect of the quizzes, the students in the unlimited lives sections had the lowest
percentage of responses referencing the unlimited attempts aspect and/or had the lowest mean on
the Likert responses. There were three exceptions to this: the number of students referencing
mastery over grades in the final course reflection (unlimited lives was in the middle of the other
two sections), and the reasons for taking the quizzes more than once. For both questions
concerning why they took the quizzes more than once (grades or mastery of content), students in
the unlimited lives section had the highest mean. This is interesting considering that they talked
about this less often and had the lowest means on liking this aspect or thinking that more classes
should offer this aspect.
Students in the badges section had the highest number of references to unlimited attempts
as compared to the other two groups in three categories of open ended responses: what they liked
best, what they would also like to say, and in the final course reflection. However, they had the
lowest percentage of all groups in the final course reflection when it came to the mastery over
102

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
grades concept. In all of the other questions, badges were either in the middle of the other two
groups or equal to the lowest group. While the students in this section liked the multiple
attempts aspect, their perception on the badges component was not as positive, with only 75% of
students viewing the achievements as a positive aspect.
Students in the level-locking section were neither the highest nor the lowest number of
references to unlimited attempts as compared to the other two groups in three categories of open
ended responses: what they liked best, what they would also like to say, and in the final course
reflection. However, they had the highest percentage of all groups in the final course reflection
when it came to the mastery over grades concept as well as the questions about feeling supported
because of multiple attempts in the end-of-course survey. An interesting aspect of students in this
section is that although they had the lowest mean scores for their reasons for taking the quizzes
more than once, they had the highest mean scores for believing that this helped them to master
the content, liking this aspect of the course, and believing that more classes should offer this
aspect. In addition, they had significantly higher levels of satisfaction around the level-locking
experience than students in the badges course had regarding achievements. See Table 21 for
synopsis of comparisons.

Additional Student Perceptions. The qualitative data from the final course reflection
and the end-of-course survey resulted in numerous open codes around ideas in addition to the
specific gamification components discussed previously (see Table 15 presented previously for
details). Four specific codes are presented below, including general student experiences, course
structure that wasn’t related to the gamification component, faculty presence in the course, and
ideas around course content that were not related to the gamification component.
General Student Experiences. In terms of student experience, a total of 66 students
(68%) out of the 97 that completed the final course reflection made a specific voluntary
comment about the course being a positive experience. This translated to 23 out of the 32
students (72%) in the unlimited lives condition, 23 out of 34 students (68%) in the Level-locking
condition, and 20 out of 31 students (65%) in the badges condition. Overall, anytime a student
made a reference to his/her experience in the course, it was mostly positive. Student comments
included things such as “I thoroughly enjoyed this course,” “I had a great experience with this
course,” “I truly had a fantastic time in this course,” and “This is definitely one of the top
favorite courses in my four years of college.” There was one student in the unlimited lives
section who stated he/she had a mixed experience due to some technical difficulties with the
quizzes, though this difficulty was never mentioned to the instructor of the course. Another
student in the badges section referenced having a negative experience due to the fact that
assignments were due at 10 pm on Sunday causing it to be difficult to stay on top of as well as
being unable to turn in late assignments or revisions of work during Week 14 of the course,
though the same student did say in the next sentence that other than those two issues, he/she
enjoyed the class.

105

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
The end of course survey specifically asked, “Do you feel supported as a student in
learning the content for this course? Why or why not?” Overall, 91% of the students responded
yes (91% in each section; 30 out of 33 students in unlimited lives, 32 out of 35 students in levellocking, and 29 out of 32 students in badges. In terms of why they felt supported, students
sometimes cited more than one reason. The most common themes across all sections was
communication, with 48% of students citing this as a reason (16 out of 33 students in unlimited
lives, 17 out of 35 students in level-locking, and 15 out of 32 students in badges). Other
responses to the question varied by section, and only responses that received more than two votes
are presented here. In the unlimited lives sections, 3 students each (9% each) cited unlimited
attempts (previously reported), the feedback on assignments, or the feeling that the instructor
was caring or helpful. In the level-locking section, 4 students each (11% each) cited unlimited
attempts (previously reported), organization of the course, or an aspect of the course content as
the reason they felt supported. Three students each (9%) stated assignment feedback or feeling
that the instructor was caring or helpful. The badges section was more diverse in responses, with
6 students (19%) citing an aspect of the course content, 5 students (16%) stating that the
instructor was caring or helpful, and three students each (9% each) stating the organization of the
course or unlimited attempts (previously reported). There were a few students that did not feel
supported. A total of nine students either said no or somewhat (9%), citing harsh grading (5) and
lack of communication (4).
The end-of-course survey also asked what the students liked best about how their
instructor taught the course. Only responses with more than two occurrences per section appear
in this section. The multiple attempts aspect was reported on previously and does not appear in
these results. While the order differed for each section, what was consistent among the sections
106

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
was that the organization of the course appeared in either the first or second ranking for all of the
sections. In the unlimited lives section, 55% (18 out of 33 students) cited organization making it
the top ranking item for that section. Organization appeared as the second ranking for level
locking with 26% of students (9 out of 35) and for badges with 34% of students (11 out of 32).
Communication and course content were also consistently mentioned in all sections.
Communication was mentioned by 4 students in unlimited lives (12%), nine students in levellocking (26%), and 13 students in badges (41%). Course content was mentioned by 6 students in
unlimited lives (18%), 14 students in level-locking (40%), and 6 students in badges (19%). Other
categories that appeared less frequently included feedback (four students (12%) in unlimited
lives and five students (16%) in badges) and multiple modes of learning (six students (17%) in
level-locking).
The final course reflection asked students to reflect on what they had learned in the
course. While most of the 97 students who completed the reflection specifically talked about the
child development concepts they had learned, a surprising number also commented on the
amount of knowledge they had gained. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the 97 students (15 students,
or 44%, of the students in level-locking, 16 students, or 52%, of the students in badges, and 21
students, or 66%, of the students in unlimited lives) discussed the amount they learned from the
course in terms of learning a lot. Comments included, “I have learned so much this semester that
I didn’t know before,” “I have learned more about the domains in a child’s life than I have in
previous classes,” “feel I have learned a great amount that I can carry on with me in the future,”
and “My growth as a student and a teacher has far beyond met my expectations this semester.”
Other comments appeared less frequently and included comments about confidence, pressure,
and flexibility. Seven (7, 7%) students (3 each in unlimited lives and badges, 1 in level-locking)
107

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
made comments related to feeling more confident, including “I realize I still have so far to go but
I am so full of confidence and I will be forever grateful,” “This class has given me a lot more
confidence with online college courses,” and “Because I’ve learned so much in this course I feel
so much more confident in my classroom when I’m talking with parents about their child’s
development.” Three students discussed feeling less pressure or stress (two students in unlimited
lives, one student in level-locking) in comments such as, “The pressure I felt was taken off due
to the positive feedback, helpful comments, easy to read rubrics, and organized learning modules”
and “I was very apprehensive about taking an online course but it was so well organized that it
was actually less stressful than classes that met in person.” In terms of flexibility (two students in
unlimited lives, one student in level-locking), representative student comments included, “It was
nice being able to work at my own pace” and “Living in a digital age means nothing to me
because I think navigating a word document is hard, so it was nice that I was able to have some
wiggle room with some assignments.”
Course Structure Other Than Gamification. Regarding course structure, eleven students
in unlimited lives (34%), eight students in level-locking (24%), and seven students in badges
(23%) commented on the organization of the course as being one of the reasons that the course
was a positive experience in their final course reflection (n = 97). Comments included, “I liked
the weekly timelines so I never got overwhelmed with anything,” and “The set-up and
procedures were very clear and concise. Instructions and guidelines were presented very
effectively, and I appreciated receiving a rubric after every assignment,” and “Although online
classes can sometimes be difficult I think the way the information was provided to us was really
easy to follow along and understand.” Forty-seven percent (47%) of the students claimed that
this was their first online course; therefore it is not surprising that online perceptions were
108

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
discussed in the final reflection. Nine students in unlimited lives (28%), eleven students in levellocking (32%), and ten students in badges (32%) discussed the course being online. Most of the
comments revealed that the students were surprised about the experience or were satisfied with
the experience, but three of the students in both unlimited lives and level-locking expressed
dissatisfaction with the online aspect of the course, stating that even though they had a good
experience they would have preferred that the course be in person instead of online. The themes
of flow and flexibility appeared in the final course reflection as well, though in extremely small
numbers, and are therefore not discussed (2 students cited flexibility, one each in unlimited lives
and level-locking, and 3 students cited flow, two in level-locking and one in badges).
Faculty Presence. In the final course reflection, few students commented on faculty
presence, but those that did discussed communication the most (four students (12.5%) in
unlimited lives, five students (15%) in level-locking, eight students in badges (29%)). Comments
included statements such as, “The professor made it very easy to stay on track and was prompt in
answering any of my questions through email” and “I am also very pleased with my instructor
for always getting back to me when I was worried about my grade, assignments, and more.”
Nine students made a statement about the instruction in the class (four students (12.5%) in
unlimited lives, three students (9%) in level-locking, two students (6%) in badges), such as “I
think the instructor did a good job of making us think about the content” or “What made it great
was that she gave us extra tools to use to help us understand the concepts in the weekly modules.”
A few students also cited getting good feedback on assignments (four students (12.5%) in
unlimited lives, one student (3%) in level-locking, one student (3%) in badges). Comments
included “I appreciated her constant feedback” and “I appreciated all of the feedback that I
received on my papers.” Six students (6) stated the instructor was caring or helpful (four students
109

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
(12%) in level-locking and two students (6%) in unlimited lives), such as “It also made me feel
like my teacher cared about me and my grade in the class.”
Course Content. The Course Content category contained statements regarding specific
concepts students learned about child development, whether they found the content useful,
whether their practice or thinking had changed, what they wanted to know more about,
comments about specific assignments that were not part of the gamification component, the
format of the content (i.e., readings or videos), the workload of the course, or various modes in
which the content was provided. While these ideas are important to course construction, most of
the comments related to this section were made as a reply to the direct prompt given for the final
course reflection. Because of this, and due to the fact that these comments do not relate to the
research question at hand, this category is not discussed moving forward. Student examples for
each of these comments are provided in Table 15 (presented previously).
Summary of Additional Student Perceptions. Overall, most students reported having a
positive experience in the course. Students also reported feeling supported in learning the content
of the course, and in their final course reflections spoke of the amount of learning. A common
theme running through all sections was the importance of both the organization of the course, the
course content, and the communication from the instructors. While the ranking of what students
like best differed throughout the sections (see Table 22 for ranking list), organization appeared in
the first or second spot in the ranking list for all sections, while communication appeared in one
of the top three spots.

Research Question 4
Research question 4 sought to determine how the student perceptions of a gamified
course correlated with the quantitative data regarding student achievement? Overall, the results
are rather mixed, with the data around the specific gamification components of level-locking and
badges supporting the student achievement results, but the results associated with multiple
attempts sometimes contradicting the student achievement data. Data are presented in terms of
each principal component and then in terms of overall satisfaction.
Principal Component 1. While differences on principal component 1 were not
significant, students in the badges section performed the lowest while students in the levellocking section performed the highest. In terms of satisfaction with the gamification component,
the student perception data appears to correlate well with the student achievement data. The
students in the badges section had lower mean scores on all of the quizzes and on the final exam
than students in the level-locking section (and in fact, had the lowest mean scores of either
111

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
section). The students in the badges section had significantly lower levels of satisfaction around
the gamification component than the students in the level-locking section; therefore, these results
support one another. The level-locking section performed higher than the unlimited lives section
on most of the quizzes (five out of the seven) and the final exam.
Even though the students in the badges section may not have appreciated the gamification
component in their section, they had the highest percentage of students reporting that the
multiple attempts aspect was something they liked best about the course. This is puzzling since
these students also had the lowest scores on the quizzes. In contrast, the unlimited lives section
had the lowest percentage of students claiming this was what they liked best, perhaps explaining
why they did not outperform the level-locking condition on most of the quizzes. In terms of
feeling supported, students in the unlimited lives and badges section had lower percentages of
students citing the multiple attempts aspect as the reason they felt supported than students in the
level-locking section. Once again, the student achievement data for the quizzes supports this
since students in the level-locking condition scored higher on most of the quizzes.
Students were asked to cite the reasons that they took the quizzes more than once.
Students in the level-locking condition had the lowest mean score for these two questions, while
students in the unlimited lives section had the highest mean score. This is rather interesting since
although the students in the unlimited lives section and the badges section said they were taking
the quizzes more than once for a better grade (and the difference between level-locking and
unlimited lives was significant), they actually scored lower than students in the level-locking
section. In contrast, even though students in the level-locking section were less likely to take the
quizzes more than once because they wanted to learn the content, they were more apt to state that
taking the quizzes more than once helped them to master the content while students in the
112

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
unlimited lives section had a lower mean. This was true for principal component 1, but not for
principal component 2 (reported in the next section).
Principal Component 2. The gamification component seemed to have an interesting
effect in principal component 2 in comparison to the previously reported results for principal
component 1. While students were able to re-submit assignments if they scored lower than 75%,
the specific gamification components of achievements and level-locking were not imposed on
the written assignments in the course that comprised principal component 2. Concerning student
achievement, the students in the unlimited lives section had the highest mean score on all but
four written assignments (two homework assignments and 2 major papers), in which the students
in the badges condition had the highest score. While the students in the level locking condition
thought the quizzes were helping them to master the content and felt more supported as a learner
because they could take the quizzes more than once, this did not prove to be true when looking at
the student achievement scores. The students in level-locking performed worse on all three major
papers, (significantly worse on the last two), and on the smaller written homework assignments
they performed worse on all but two. Students in the badges section seemed to feel more
supported as a result of the quiz attempts than students in the unlimited lives section, but not as
much as students in the level-locking section. Students in the badging section were less likely
than students in the unlimited lives section to take the quizzes more than once because they
wanted to learn the content, and their percentage was only slightly less than the students in the
level-locking section. While they may not have taken the quizzes in order to learn the content,
slightly more students in the badging section strongly agreed that taking the quizzes more than
once helped them to learn the content, scoring closely to students in the unlimited lives section
but well below students in the level-locking section. For the major written assignments, they had
113

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
the highest score on two of the three assignments, and for the other they scored higher than levellocking but lower than unlimited lives. In four of the eight written homework assignments, they
again scored higher than level-locking but lower than unlimited lives. In the remaining four
written homework assignments, they had the lowest score on two, and the highest score on two.
Student Perceptions. Students in the level-locking section performed significantly lower
on final course grade than students in the unlimited lives condition, even though they were
forced to score at least 80% on their quizzes. While there were no significant differences in final
mean grade between the other sections, it should be noted that level-locking performed the worst
and unlimited lives performed the best. In addition, level-locking was the only condition in
which at least one student did not pass the course after the outliers were removed. This is
interesting since the students in the unlimited lives section mentioned this aspect less, felt less
supported by this aspect than the other sections, and did not think that the multiple attempts on
quizzes helped them learn the content. The fact that they did not score the highest grades on
quizzes but still had the highest final grades suggests that their perceptions about the multiple
attempts were accurate, and that there may have been something else that contributed to their
performance more than the multiple quiz opportunities. Another interesting aspect of the final
course reflection was that the students in the level locking section mentioned mastery over
grades just as often as the students in the unlimited lives section and more than students in the
badges section, yet they did not master the content as well. In terms of feeling supported in
learning the content, all three sections claimed a 91% satisfaction rate.

Chapter 5
Discussion
The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to investigate the effects of individual
gamification components on student achievement, including in terms of motivation orientation at
the beginning of the course, and to survey student perceptions of the gamified course sections.
This chapter will interpret the results of the study, discuss the implications of the findings for
future online courses, and discuss the limitations of the study. Suggestions for further research
will also be presented.
As stated in the literature review chapter, previous studies have presented mixed results
in terms of gamification components in college courses; however only six studies in the field of
education have isolated a gamification component to study its effects (Abramovich et al., 2013;
Banfield & Wilkerson, 2014; Burkey et al., 2013; Fanfarelli & McDaniel, 2015; Gibbons, 2013;
Hakulinen et al., 2015). Adding to this body of research, current findings from this study suggest
that success on lower order thinking assignments do not necessarily improve achievement on
assignments that require higher order thinking, and in fact, depending on the gamification
component, they could have a detrimental effect. In addition, some gamification components
may have worse effects on student achievement than others.
Assignment Alignment
Initial assumptions by the college department of the assignments in the course were that
assignments around similar topics would be most highly correlated with one another. For
example, in the Introductory Child Development course, students completed a quiz, a homework
assignment, and a paper around several major topics in the course, such as the topic of physical
and motor development. The assumption by the department was that the quiz on physical and
115

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
motor development, the homework around physical and motor development, and the major paper
around physical and motor development would be highly correlated with one another. In fact, for
these sections, the principal components analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation suggested
something entirely different. As an example, the correlations between the quiz and the
homework and the quiz and the major paper for the physical and motor development topic
were .264 and .281 respectively. The PCA resulted in all of the quizzes and the final exams
grouping on one component, with the written assignments grouping on the second component.
There were two major differences in these assignments. First, the quizzes and final exam were
comprised of matching, multiple choice, and true/false questions. There were no essay questions
or open-ended responses required on the quiz. The homework assignments and major papers
were all written assignments that required students to write about the topics rather than choose
from pre-determined answers. Another difference between the two types of assignments was that
the majority of the questions on the quizzes and tests were knowledge based questions rather
than application questions, while the written assignments were either application of the
knowledge or they required students to reiterate the knowledge in different terms. This suggests
that the grouping of assignments in the PCA resulted more from type of knowledge requested by
the assignment rather than the topic of the assignment. Principal Component 1, consisting of
quizzes and the final exam, consisted of remembering or understanding factual information, such
as recalling definitions or matching sub-stages of a theory with the corresponding components.
These skills of remembering or understanding comprise the lowest levels of the Taxonomy for
Learning, Teaching, and Assessing, otherwise known as the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy
(Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). The higher levels of the taxonomy, including the skills of

116

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
applying, analyzing, and creating were evident in the written assignments for the class, or those
that grouped onto Principal Component 2.
Implications for restructuring courses. These results have implications for the
structuring of college course assessments. It may be necessary to rethink what is meant by the
term “alignment.” Most instructors likely think of alignment as ensuring that objectives match
the content which in turn matches the assessments. This might be termed “topic alignment” or
“knowledge alignment.” The results of this study suggest that it may be just as important, if not
more important, to think about “skill set alignment,” in which instructors create assignments that
scaffold the skill set with which they desire students to exit the course. The knowledge
components would be embedded within the skill set, but the assessments would be designed
around further developing the skill set. For example, the current course attempted to provide a
leveling experience by moving the assessments from lower order thinking to higher order
thinking by beginning with a quiz which asked knowledge based questions, then moving to a
homework assignment that required slightly higher order thinking, and then culminating in a
final paper that required higher order thinking. Rather than thinking about assessments around
topics that move from lower order thinking to higher order thinking, it may be more beneficial to
begin with assessments that focus on the desired skill set, such as having a quiz that focuses on
application types of questions, such as choosing examples of a concept or identifying correct
application of a concept, and then moving gradually towards more concrete assignments to
demonstrate the desired skill set. Future research should evaluate how assessments that are
designed with this type of assessment structure or “skill set alignment” correlate with one
another in a course.

117

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
The redemption effect. On both the quizzes and the written assignments, students
exhibited what has been coined a “redemption effect” by the researcher. The redemption effect
occurred when student grades spiked after a prior steady decrease. Though the effect started at
slightly different places for the different types of assignments, it was visibly clear for both types
of assignments in all sections. For quizzes, the steady decrease began after the third quiz during
week 5 and continued through week 11, with the redemption effect occurring in Week 13 with
the last quiz. On the written assignments, the mean grades steadily declined from the first week
until week 9, after which they began to rise again. Further research should evaluate whether this
effect occurs in other courses.
Gamification Component Effects on Student Achievement
Badges. Students in the badges section scored the lowest of any section on all of the
quizzes. They also had significantly lower levels of satisfaction around the achievements in the
course. While there were a large number of students who expressed satisfaction with the
achievements (87%), there were also a number who disagreed with the idea of achievements in a
college course (13%). Regardless of student perception, the reality is that the achievement of
students on the quizzes was consistently lower. Achievements were attached only to the quizzes
in this course because research has suggested that external rewards do not undermine intrinsic
motivation for tasks that are dull since there is little intrinsic motivation in such tasks (Ryan et al.,
1983). However, based on the results of student achievement on the quizzes, one has to wonder
about the validity in this scenario since the scores were consistently lower. While only the sixth
quiz (week 11) was significantly different (p = .026), the seventh quiz approached significance (p
= .068). The grade trends for the badging section generally followed that of the other sections
except for the middle quiz (week 6) which spiked as the other sections’ grades declined. Students
118

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
in the badges course had the same opportunities as students in other sections to take the quizzes
unlimited times, and since everything else in the course was identical it’s likely that it was the
achievements that influenced the lower scores.
What is interesting about the badges section is that although their mean quiz grades were
lower than the other two sections, the same trend was not true for the written assignments. In fact,
the only thing that was consistent about the mean scores of the written assignments in
comparison to the other groups is that they were inconsistent. Students in the badges section had
the lowest mean score on two of the homework assignments. They also had the highest mean
score for two of the homework assignments. The students in the badges section had the highest
score on two of the three major written papers. This suggests that while the badges may have
negatively influenced the assignments to which they were attached, there was no carryover to the
other assignments in the course. To further support this point, the final exam consisted of the
same questions that were part of the quizzes, but it only allowed one attempt and did not have a
badge attached to it. There was virtually no difference in final exam scores between the sections
(difference of .33% between badges and unlimited lives and .24% difference between badges and
unlimited lives). From the data, it is difficult to determine whether the badges actually benefitted
or harmed scores on assignments that did not have badges attached.
Badging patterns. While patterns of badge earning were not in the scope of this study,
there were some interesting trends. In terms of how many badges were earned for each quiz, the
number remained relatively stable throughout the course (between 24 and 29). In this study,
there was no clear pattern in terms of students who earned badges and those who didn’t. For
example, even though the number of students who did not earn a badge remained consistent
throughout the course, there was no student in the course that earned zero or just one badge. The
119

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
overall data patterns appear to suggest a novelty effect for students who were more extrinsically
motivated at the beginning of the course. Fanfarelli and McDaniel (2015) studied badges in
terms of student characteristics and found that not all learners benefit from badges in the same
way, and this may be due to how different types of learners respond to gamification components
(Barata, Gama, Jorge, & Goncalves, 2014). While significant differences are not present in the
current study, the inconsistency of performance and badge earning is certainly intriguing and
warrants further research.
Implications for restructuring courses. These results have significant implications for
future college courses. Given the current data, there is no evidence to support the benefit of
badges in raising student achievement when they are connected to earned grades. In fact, the
badges may harm achievement for the assignments to which they are attached. Previous studies
have demonstrated that badges may have a positive influence on student behavior when they are
given for specific tasks rather than grades, such as spending more time in the learning
environment, time management, carefulness, or student contributions (Auvinen & Korhonen,
2015; Denny, 2013). Haaranen et al. (2014) did not find significant effects on behavior, but the
difference in this study was that their badges were tied to student learning in addition to other
behaviors. Could it be possible that linking external rewards of any kind to grades hinders any
change in behavior? It is difficult to answer this question at this point in time because the
research that has addressed badging to date have only claimed no statistical difference in student
achievement. While the students in the badges section may not have appreciated the gamification
component in their section, they did have the highest percentage of students reporting that the
multiple attempts aspect was something they liked best about the course. Since they also had the
lowest scores on the quizzes, this begs the question of whether the badges hindered their
120

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
motivation to earn a higher grade, in turn hindering their behavior in taking the quizzes multiple
times to earn a higher grade. The current research supports this claim, but perhaps more
investigation should occur given the trends that were associated with the achievements. Future
studies should consider the difference between badges tied to grades only, badges tied to
behaviors only, and badges tied to both grades and behaviors in terms of whether the badges
influence student achievement or behavior. Since the total number of students continuing to
attempt the quiz after reaching the 80% score required to earn a badge declined steadily
throughout the course, future studies should also consider the effects of stagnant badges (in
which only one type of badge is earned per activity) versus badges of different levels (such as a
bronze, silver, and gold) to determine if these have an effect on achievement or behavior.
Additionally, future studies should consider motivation orientation at various times during the
course to determine if badges have a significant effect on motivation as the course progresses.
Level-locking. Students in the level-locking section claimed they were taking the quizzes
more than once for a better grade. They also claimed that they did not take the quizzes more than
once because they wanted to learn the content. This makes sense because these students were
required to earn a specific score on the quizzes in order to move forward in the course and
therefore were likely taking the quizzes out due to this requirement. In other words, the locus of
causality was external. Students in the level-locking section were more likely than students in
other sections to think that taking the quizzes more than once helped them to master the content.
Whether this is true or not really depends on how one defines the idea of “mastering the content.”
If mastering the content means that students mastered the types of lower-order knowledge that
was required of the quizzes, then the students would be correct in their claim. However, if
“mastering the content” means that students are able to take the lower-order knowledge gained
121

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
by the quizzes and apply that knowledge to a higher-order assignment at the same or higher level
of competence, then their claim would be incorrect. While the level-locking component was set
at 80%, the mean score of the quizzes for this section never fell below 91.88%, or an A.
Therefore, it appears that the level-locking was a motivating component to earn a high score. A
different, and troubling, trend occurred in regards to the written assignments. Their first two
homework assignments resulted in mean scores of an A, but thereafter written assignments never
earned more than a B, and some (3) had a mean score below 80%. While the level-locking
component may have helped with quizzes, it seemed to harm scores for the written assignments.
There could be several reasons for this. First, students could have focused so much attention on
passing the quizzes that they spent less cognitive load on preparing the written assignments. This
is problematic since higher order thinking is a skill that is valued in college. Another possibility
is that the level-locking served as a form of outside control that deprived students of a sense of
autonomy or a sense of competence in the course, resulting in lower self-determination (Ryan
and Deci, 2000). Students may have felt a lack of control over outcomes since they were forced
to attain a specific score. They may have felt a lack of autonomy because the drive to attain the
score was coming from an external locus of causality rather than an internal drive. Without this
sense of autonomy or sense of competence, intrinsic motivation is likely to decrease (Ryan &
Deci, 2000), resulting in lower scores. It is unlikely that the level-locking component resulted in
feelings of frustration since the student perceptions were positive for this type of gamification.
With results such as these, it is imperative that instructors implement policies to create a
sense of autonomy and competence within courses. Autonomy can be achieved in online courses
in a variety of ways. Any type of option that allows for choice will assist students in feeling
autonomous. It may not be feasible to provide students with control over the schedule of readings
122

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
or assignments, but instructors can offer options within the structure of the course. For example,
instructors could provide a collection of readings around a specific topic and allow students to
choose two of the options to read. Another method of providing choice may involve the
assignments. Instructors can allow students a choice in the method of completing the assignment,
such as writing a paper, producing a video, or creating a voiced presentation of the content. In
addition, instructors could provide students with options on the type of information to pursue,
such as providing a list of topics for exploration and allowing the student to choose the topic of
the assignment. An additional way to provide control for students is to allow students to choose
their own due date from a pre-specified list for major assignments. This might take the form of a
sign-up sheet with specific dates listed in which students may choose when they would like to
submit the assignment. A sense of control over outcomes can be established by providing clear
performance requirements including grading policies, rubrics, and time estimates for completing
activities. Competence might also be encouraged by ensuring that feedback includes not only
directions for improvement but also specific praise for what the student has done well. Another
way of providing a sense of competence might include encouraging emails to students about
their performance in the class. In addition, instructors can ensure that they are providing
appropriate scaffolding to students to help them meet outcomes, including providing a place for
remediation of related concepts if students need additional assistance.
Directions for future research include evaluating the effects of level-locking when other
measures are put into place to instill competence and autonomy, which may vary from course to
course. Other research should evaluate the effects of level-locking when it is implemented on all
assignments within the course. Longitudinal studies should evaluate the long term effects of
level-locking on autonomy and competence, as well as the effects on later program knowledge
123

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
when level-locking is instituted in a course with pre-requisite knowledge to a later course. In
addition, future research should evaluate the effect on student achievement if the percentage to
move forward in the course was raised from 80% to either 85% or 90% to determine if this
higher level of achievement would result in carryover to the other types of activities.
Unlimited lives. All of the sections had the unlimited lives feature in their course. One
limitation of the current study is that there was no control group with whom to compare the
unlimited lives section to determine how this feature alone may have influenced student
achievement. While the results can be presented in comparison to the other two sections, the true
effects of offering just the unlimited lives feature is difficult to determine and should be
evaluated in future research.
What can be said about the unlimited lives section is that this group never had the lowest
score for any of the assignments, a finding that suggests that the other gamification components
studied may be unnecessary to attain higher student achievement. Many of the students
commented on the idea that having the freedom to fail, then retake the quiz for a higher score,
lowered their anxiety about the quizzes. However, having unlimited attempts on the quizzes may
have some other implications. While it was not a focus of this study, examination of the quiz
attempts revealed that students most often took the quizzes on the same day, often very shortly
after submitting the previous attempt. The quizzes had features installed including time limits,
one question presented at a time, no backtracking, randomization of answers, randomization of
questions, and showing only scores but no answers in the results to deter students from guessing
the first time through and then using those answers to inform the next attempt. The hope in
implementing unlimited lives was that students would review the course materials in order to
learn the material before attempting the quiz again. It does not appear that students actually took
124

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
time in between quizzes to review. Future research should evaluate student actions between and
during quiz attempts as well as allowing freedom to fail with a limited number of re-attempts
rather than unlimited attempts to determine if this increases carefulness in responses or whether
students were guessing on the answers. Future research should also evaluate wait times between
quiz attempts while giving the students an opportunity to describe their actions before and after
each quiz attempt to determine patterns of behavior. Understanding these patterns of behaviors
could shape the way instructors present quizzes to students in the future.
Student Perceptions
Overall, students in all three sections felt supported in learning the content. While some
students cited the gamification components as being part of the reason, the biggest reasons for
feeling supported were the communication that occurred in the course and the organization of the
course. It is important to delineate that communication and feedback on assignments were not
one in the same, and students specifically mentioned communication in the form of
announcements, emails, or phone calls. The implication here is that by and large, students
appreciate any attempt that instructors make to support them in their learning, but the most effort
should be placed on the course organization and the communication within the course before
focusing on other types of strategies. Perhaps the most interesting part of the student perception
data is the fact that the student perceptions and actual effects of the components did not
necessarily support one another. Students in the level locking section mentioned mastery over
grades just as often as the students in the unlimited lives section and more than students in the
badges section, yet they did not master the content as well as students in the other sections.
While student perception data is interesting and provides a view into the “why” of student
behavior, undoubtedly an important piece, collecting student perception data alone is likely not
125

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
enough to support the implementation of gamification components in a course. Empirical
research on student achievement is needed before conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness
of specific gamification components.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that prevent generalizability. First, the study was
conducted on one course in an undergraduate program in one university. Further research among
other content areas, other programs, other universities, and with graduate students is needed
before results could be generalized. In addition, this research was conducted in an online course,
so generalizability to face-to-face courses or blended courses is also limited. In addition, there
was no control group for this study. Student enrollment prevented a fourth group; therefore
conclusions cannot be drawn in comparison to a course without any gamification components.
As stated previously, university guidelines for teaching load prohibited the same instructor from
teaching all sections in the same semester. The course sites for the gamification sections were
identical in terms of content. While the two instructors for this course strived for sameness in
terms of communication and grading, it is possible that differences in the instructors caused part
of the differences in sections. In addition, students generally took this course in their freshman or
sophomore year of a program; therefore results may not be generalizable for courses taking place
further into a program’s curriculum. Student perception data was collected in the form of a final
course reflection and end-of-course survey. While the end of course survey was anonymous, the
final course reflection was submitted as part of the course work. Therefore, opinions given as
part of the final course reflection may have been influenced by the fact that the instructor would
see the answers prior to assigning a grade for the course.

126

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE
Conclusion
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to answer four specific questions about
gamification components: how do the specific gamification components of unlimited lives,
badges, and level-locking affect student achievement; is there a significant difference in
achievement in extrinsically motivated students versus intrinsically motivated students in a
gamified online course; what are student perceptions of the gamified components of unlimited
lives, badges, and level-locking in an online course; and how do student perceptions of a
gamified course correlate with data regarding student achievement. Of the three gamification
components, unlimited lives was the only one that did not show any negative effects in terms of
student achievement measured. Badges resulted in the lowest achievement for the assignments
that awarded badges, and level-locking resulted in the lowest scores for higher-order thinking
assignments when the level-locking was attached to lower-order assignments. Motivation
orientation did not have a significant difference on student achievement between the gamified
sections. In summary, while student perceptions of gamified courses may be positive, these
perceptions do not always support the actual achievement data in the courses.

Scoring Guide for MLSQ
The MSLQ was scored following the directions in the Motivated Strategies for Learning
Questionnaire Manual (Pintrich et al., 1991). Directions state:
Scales are constructed by taking the mean of the items that make up that scale. For
example, intrinsic goal orientation (see page 9) has four items. An individual's score for
intrinsic goal orientation would be computed by summing the four items and taking the
average. Items marked as "reversed" are reverse coded items and must be reflected before
scale construction. These negatively worded items and the ratings have to be reversed
before an individual's score can be computed.

Study ID: 2015-5465
Re:

Study Title: Improving Content Mastery in Online Courses with the use of
Achievements and Adaptive Release Tools

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) acknowledges receipt of the above referenced proposal. It
was determined that this proposal does not meet the regulatory criteria for research involving
human subjects (see below): Not generalizable – QA/QI of instructional design and

teaching practices in the Early Childhood Education Online program at the University
of Cincinnati. Ongoing IRB oversight is not required.
Please note the following requirements:
Statement regarding International conference on Harmonization and Good clinical
Practices. The Institutional Review Board is duly constituted (fulfilling FDA requirements for
diversity), has written procedures for initial and continuing review of clinical trials: prepares

172

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE

written minutes of convened meetings and retains records pertaining to the review and approval
process; all in compliance with requirements defined in 21 CFR Parts 50, 56 and 312 Code of
Federal Regulations. This institution is in compliance with the ICH GCP as adopted by
FDA/DHHS.

Thank you for your cooperation during the review process.

45 CRF § 46.102(d): Research means a systematic investigation, including research
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable
knowledge.

45 CRF § 46.102(f): Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator
(whether professional or student) conducting research obtains:
1. data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
2. identifiable private information.

Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example,
venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed
for research purposes.

Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject.
Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an
individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and
information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the
individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical
173

GAMIFICATION IN AN ONLINE COURSE

record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is
or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for
obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.

FDA regulations apply whenever an individual is or becomes a participant in research, either
as a recipient of a FDA-regulated product or as a control, and as directed by a research protocol
and not by medical practice. FDA-regulated activities involve individuals, specimens, or data, as
patients or healthy controls, in any of the following:
a. any use of a drug or biologic, other than the use of an approved drug or biologic in the
course of medical practice
b. any use of a device (medical or other devices, approved or investigational) to test the
safety or effectiveness of the device
c. any use of dietary supplements to cure, treat, or prevent a disease or bear a nutrient
content claim or other health claim
d. the collection of data or other results from individuals that will be submitted to, or held
for inspection by, the FDA as part of an application for a research or marketing permit
(including foods, infant formulas, food and color additives, drugs for human use, medical
devices for human use, biological products for human use, and electronic products.)
e. activities where specimens (of any type) from individuals, regardless of whether
specimens are identifiable, are used to test the safety or effectiveness of any device
(medical or other devices, approved or investigational) and the information is being
submitted to, or held for inspection by, the FDA.
