Dissertation Abstract

Policy makers and academicians often view slums as disorderly, substandard, corrupt,
makeshift, impoverished, crime-ridden eyesores and so forth. However, conceptualizing
slums as resilient enclaves challenges this common perception of slum dwellers as
passive disaster victims and instead, shifts focus onto their ingenuity and adaptability to
overcome external circumstances. Resilience comprises three dimensions: coping,
adaptive, and transformative capacities. The first two dimensions, coping and adaptive
capacities, refer to the slum dwellers’ ability to bounce back to their original state in the
aftermath of a disaster, often relying on their informal social networks. Transformative
capacity, in contrast, refers to the slum dwellers’ ability to improve or upgrade the
physical (e.g., water, sewer or roads) and social (e.g., education, empowerment or job
skills) infrastructure of their community in the aftermath of a disaster.

This dissertation explores the transformative capacity of the Pedda Jalaripeta (from here
on referred as PJ) slum in Visakhapatnam, India through empirical ethnographic
research. This study analyzes how the residents of PJ collaborated with both the
government and non-governmental organizations over the past six decades to improve
the physical and social infrastructure of the slum overcoming many external
circumstances

Resilience, primarily the transformative capacity of the PJ residents, is presented in this
dissertation through three perspectives: temporal, spatial and social. The temporal
perspective narrates the disasters that the PJ faced over the past three decades. The
spatial perspective demonstrates ‘Why’ the PJ residents fight for their community as
their turf. The social perspective attempts to understand the ‘How’ in resilience - how did
2

the PJ residents with minimal education and monetary resources survive multiple
disasters? While many studies considered urban slums as vulnerable (Davis 2006,
World Bank, 2016; UN Habitat, 2010), this dissertation illustrates that slums can be
resilient and survive multiple catastrophes if they engage and collaborate with external
agencies.

I have been fortunate to experience support from many sides during my Ph.D. I would
like to dedicate this dissertation to my loving husband and my beautiful boys Krish &
Ram for their unfailing support through what is undoubtedly the most arduous
undertaking of my life so far.

A heartfelt thank you goes to my supervisor, Dr. Mahyar Arefi, for his prompt responses
to my emails, for reviewing my many drafts patiently, and for always being
approachable. I have been lucky to benefit from such a supportive and kind supervisor. I
am hugely indebted to Dr. David Edelman, who educated me and guided me throughout
this process. He was a source of positive energy always assuring me that I am on the
right track. Dr. Erynn Casanova was a guide when I felt lost; she exerted gentle pressure
on me when I needed; she consoled me when I got frustrated. Her substantive and
critical comments on the dissertation drafts have significantly improved the end product.

My research would not have been possible without the assistance of many people in
India. Firstly many thanks to Naveen Potti, for providing me with the data and connecting
me with right people in the government agencies. My dissertation would be non-existent
without the willingness of many persons to give some of their time to answer my
questions. I am grateful to all the staff at GVMC for indulging my queries, in particular,
Mr. Vijay Kanth and Ms. Usha Rani at GVMC for educating me about the welfare
schemes in general and the Pedda Jalaripeta slum in particular. I also wish to thank
Laxman Rao at the Department of Fisheries for taking an interest in my research.

Most importantly, my immense thanks go to the many community residents, community
leaders, and members of the Pedda Jalaripeta, who so warmly welcomed me into their
5

homes and meetings. I am thankful for their generosity and patience answering my many
questions. I owe a debt to Appayya Tata, who took me under his wing and spent
countless hours introducing me to everyone within the community.

Finally, I want to thank my family for being immersing me in a constant fountain of love
and life. Behind every successful man is a woman, but behind every successful woman
is her entire family. I am grateful to my in-laws and my parents for supporting me
throughout this journey. My Father-in-law (Apparao Monangi) and Mother-in-law (Kalyani
Monangi) accompanied me on my field work; they walked with me for hours at a stretch;
talked and mingled with the slum dwellers; waited for me to finish my focus groups or
discussions. I am grateful for the hours and months that they have given up to help me
with the research. With a peaceful demeanor and cheerful smile, my Sister-in-law
(Srilaxmi Andavarapu) took care of my kids as her own leaving me to delve deeper into
my fieldwork.

My parents are two of the most humble, kind and caring people I have ever met. I honor
and appreciate everything they have given me, the opportunities they have selflessly
provided, and how they model unconditional love. They have supported me, cherished
me and encouraged me throughout the process.

My husband, Nagendra Monangi is the one who pushed me to pursue my dream, this
dissertation would not be possible without his financial, philosophical, and mainly
spiritual support. He is my rock, a source of my energy and an unnervingly honest
critique of my work. Most of all thanks to him for proofreading the entire dissertation,

Introduction
The PJ witnessed a myriad of natural disasters like most urban slums since its inception
four decades ago. In 1984, a small accident quickly turned into a massive fire and
destroyed more than two-thirds of the slum, killing hundreds of people and left thousands
homeless. In 2004, Indian Ocean earthquake and the resultant tsunami, which was one
of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history, wreaked havoc and destroyed the
entire PJ. More recently, the community witnessed an avalanche of tourism-oriented
developments threatening not only to gentrify the entire PJ community but also
challenging the livelihood of its residents (fishing). Despite these natural and manmade
disasters, the PJ residents in collaboration with government and non-government
organizations transformed their physical (i.e., roads, water and sewer) and social
(education and empowerment) infrastructure of their community. This dissertation
explores PJ’s transformations using qualitative ethnographic methods. Resilience
comprises of three dimensions, coping, adaptive and transformative capacities (Keck &
Etzold, 2013, Chelleri et al. (2015). This dissertation analyzes the transformative
capacity of the PJ through temporal, spatial and social lenses.

The term 'slum' in a general context refers to describe a broad range of densely
populated, low-income urban settlements and communities (UN-Habitat, 2003). The
catchall term 'slum' is loose and considered deprecatory. It has many connotations and
meanings and is banned from the many of the more sensitive, academic and politically
correct lexicons (Gilbert, 2007). Despite these limitations, this terminology deemed
appropriate to use in this dissertation for three reasons: First, studies I draw from such
as State of the World Cities (UN-Habitat, 2010) or Global Monitoring Report (World Bank
Group, 2016) referred to these types of settlements as slums. Second, in several
12

developing countries like India, these communities embrace the term and use their
political leverage to become identified as one because an official slum notification1 is a
prerequisite for government initiated welfare programs, such as low-interest loans, low
utility bills (Naidu, 2006). Third, instead of shying away from the term, ‘slum’,
academicians and scholars ought to refine it to reduce the pejorative connotations
associated with it.

Slums or informal settlements are a core feature of urbanization in the “Global South”. By
the year 2030, as a direct consequence of unprecedented urban growth, approximately 2
billion people are expected to be living in slums- twice as many as of today (World Bank
Group, 2016). Nearly 90 percent of this urban growth is projected to concentrate in Asia
and Sub-Saharan African regions; being home to most of the world's slum population
already, these two regions are expected to see an exponential increase in those
numbers (World Bank Group, 2016). This large-scale urbanization coupled with a lack of
affordable housing creates a perfect breeding ground for slum proliferation (UN-Habitat,
2010).

Greater employment opportunities and better access to infrastructure facilities have led
to increased rates of urbanization, and the locus of poverty is rapidly shifting to urban
areas (Rakodi & Lloyd-Jones, 2002). The relationship between urbanization and poverty
is complex, multifactorial and volatile. On one hand, urbanization provides better income
opportunities, access to schools, and health care facilities (Rakodi & Lloyd-Jones, 2002,
p. 30). On the other hand, the urban poor face far more health-related problems than

and protects the occupancy rights of the residents (Nakamura, 2014).

13

their rural counterparts and pay more to access vital necessities such as water and
sewer (UN-Habitat 2010, p. 22). Data from Indian Census 2011 reinforce these findings,
where slum dwellers have better access to infrastructure such as water, sewerage, and
electricity than their rural counterparts. Informal settlements continue to emerge at the
fringes of new satellite towns to render services to the middle and upper-income
residents of these settlements (Rumbach, 2014).

Given their prevalence in the world, informal settlements are receiving greater attention
from planning professionals and academics. Journals such as Planning Theory and
Practice (2011), Built Environment (2011), City (2011), International Development
Planning Review (2012) and Habitat International recently published special issues on
informal urbanism. This recent explosion of research created a rich database of
empirical and theoretical research articles aimed at exploring new ways of thinking about
informality in urban areas.

Scholars use a variety of theoretical conceptualizations such as world-class cities &
globalization (Weinstein, 2014); advanced marginality (Ghertner, 2010); law, space &
gender (Datta, 2012) and the ladder of community participation (K. Patel, 2013) to study
slums. The majority of these scholarly publications focus on complexities involved in
slum redevelopment rather than analyzing their existing social capital.

Traditional media often characterizes slums as vulnerable and portrays slum residents
are as victims. Applying a resilience lens to study these social systems will expose the
slum dwellers survival and resilience strategies in the face of external threats such as
fire, flood, eviction or gentrification. A holistic understanding of these external challenges

14

and survival techniques is only plausible by looking beyond the statistics through an indepth ethnographic study.

Extant literature on slum resilience has primarily focused on the coping/adaptive
capacities of the urban poor with a minimal focus on their transformative capacity
(Chatterjee, 2010; Davis, 2006; Keck & Etzold, 2013; Wilhelm, 2011). Slum
transformations are mostly controversial and negatively viewed as they are poorly
constructed, and often these redevelopments destroy the social and ecological networks
within slums (S. Patel, 2013; Perlman, 1976). This dissertation argues that slum
redevelopment or transformation can result in long-term resilience, especially when
external government and non-governmental agencies partner with slum dwellers.

This dissertation is organized into the following chapters, transformative capacity in the
context of slum redevelopment is explored through an ethnographic research of the
Pedda Jalaripeta (PJ) slum in Visakhapatnam. The PJ in Visakhapatnam faced multiple
challenges such as fire, floods, and an influx of tourism oriented redevelopments over its
60-year history. Despite these circumstances, the PJ has transformed from a vulnerable
fishing village to a sustainable low-income urban neighborhood with accessible
infrastructure facilities (access to water, sewer, and roads) while retaining its social
capital and ecological capital. The study of PJ provides a unique opportunity to explore
the long-term transformative capacity of slum dwellers and study resilience of slum. This
dissertation will explore three research questions:

1. ‘Resilience to What’: What are the disasters that the PJ residents faced and
survived over the past three decades? (Temporal Perspective)

15

2. ‘Resilience, Why’: Why did the PJ residents fight for their community as their
turf? (Spatial Perspective)
3. ‘Resilience, How’: How did the PJ residents survive multiple disasters? (Social
Perspective)

Most of the existing literature on slum resilience focuses on ‘Resilience to what?’
(Chatterjee, 2010; Wilhelm, 2011; Ajibade et al., 2013; Keck & Etzold, 2013). This
dissertation expands the existing resilience literature through exploring not just the
‘resilience to what?’ But the ‘Why?’ and ‘How?’ of resilience. This research will illustrate
the survival strategies of slum dwellers and demonstrate how the community
transformed from a vulnerable state to a resilient state. This case study exemplifies the
role of government and non-government agencies in creating resilient urban enclaves.
The ‘Resilient Slums Framework’ designed based on this case study is a powerful
template to conduct a holistic analysis of resilience in a community (either a slum or an
inner city neighborhood).

In this dissertation, Chapter 1 narrates the evolution of theoretical and political
perception of slums. Chapter 2 analyzes the six commonly used definitions of resilience
in urban planning research, identifies the most appropriate definition in the context of
slums and summarizes the empirical evidence of resilience in slums. Chapters 3
provides a background of the City of Visakhapatnam, defines and operationalizes the
notion of transformative capacity and identifies the PJ as the appropriate case for this
research. Chapter 4 reports the research methods, data analysis, and limitations of this
case study.

16

Chapters 5 through 7 present the multi-perspective analysis of resilience in the PJ. The
temporal perspective (chapter 5) discusses the disasters that the PJ witnessed and
survived over the past three decades. The spatial perspective (chapter 6) reviews Why
the PJ dwellers invested time, money and labor to protect their community. The social
perspective (chapter 7) explores how the residents collaborated with government and
non-government agencies to transform the physical (roads, water, sewer and others)
and social (education and empowerment) infrastructure of the PJ. The conclusion
chapter reflects on the key findings from this dissertation and proposes new directions
for future research.

Chapter 1: Slum Redevelopment Policies (1950-2015): A
Changing Narrative

Elected representatives and policy makers often focus on creating memorable and
cherished urban landscapes (Ghertner, 2010; Roy, 2014; Weinstein, 2014). The title on
these visions changed over the years: ‘rational scientific city’, ‘world-class city’ or ‘slumfree cities’. However, one thing that was missing from all these visions is the
transformation of slums, which were often the forgotten, hidden, despised, and
controversial underbellies of cities. Instead of redevelopment or transformation, these
policies often advocate for demolition or relocation of slums. Slums are vital to the
incessant humdrum of cities, and often service workers such as the taxi drivers, maids,
beauticians and even low wage government workers can only afford to live in slums
(Davis, 2006; Neuwirth, 2006). Policy makers therefore often struggle to find a balance
between these two seemingly opposing goals of creating modern urban areas while
improving the lives of the urban poor.

The constant tension between these two objectives has manifested in the multitude of
slum redevelopment policies developed and implemented over the years. A
comprehensive historical account of the scholarly literature on slums and the relevant
policy documents reveals that there are four types of slum redevelopment policies. In
this chapter, these four policy models and their theoretical underpinnings are elucidated
(figure 1).

The culture of poverty and marginality theories, which portrayed slums as problematic
dens of violence and prostitution, were the first type of such account. They advocated
policies to demolish slums and construct large-scale public housing projects to rehouse
18

the slum residents. The United States implemented the public housing programs as part
of the New Deal. The U.S. policy inspired similar policies in developing countries like
Brazil and India (Davis, 2006; Gans, 1982; Gilbert & Ward, 1985; Neuwirth, 2006;
Perlman, 1976).

The backlash following these public housing projects prompted the evolution of
alternative theoretical models to explore slums. Scholars invested in qualitative
ethnographic research to shed new light on the social and cultural lives of the slum
dwellers. These researchers argued that the slum residents were not mere parasites of
the society, but play an essential and integral role in the daily functioning of the city.
Their research illustrated that slum dwellers invest in their houses and improve their
communities one brick at a time (Castells, 1983; Gans, 1982; Jacobs, 1961; Perlman,
1976; Turner, 1976). Thus, the second model of slum redevelopment policies emerged
based on the concept of incremental redevelopment. World Bank sponsored many of
these incremental slum redevelopment policies, which incorporated the self-help
ideology as first introduced by Turner (1976).

In the third model, NGOs and empowered slum dwellers became active partners in the
slum redevelopment policies. (Appadurai, 2001; Patel, d’Cruz, & Burra, 2002; Pugh,
1995). Using tools such as slum enumeration surveys, micro- savings loans, toilet
festivals and others the NGOs such as SPARC and Mahila Milan empowered the slum
dwellers to collaborate with government officials. Appadurai (2001) calls this the, “rightsbased moment”, where the recipients of the grant negotiate directly with the donor on the
same platform: deep democracy.

19

Cities Alliance launched the fourth policy model in 1999 titled ‘cities without slums’. Cities
Alliance represents several supra national agencies including UN-Habitat and the World
Bank. Countries such as India and Thailand implemented large-scale domestic
programs to create slum free cities (Boonyabancha & Mitlin, 2012; S. Patel, 2013). This
chapter analyzes these four redevelopment models through case studies to explore the
changing academic and policy narrative on slums.

Type 1: Public Housing (1950-1972)
The earliest references to slums can be traced back to Victorian England where Engels
(1892) illustrated the squalid living conditions of industrial workers in England. Half a
century later, Jacob Riis published ‘How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the
Tenements of New York’ (Riis, 1901) attesting to the similar inhabitable living conditions
in New York tenements. These candid portrayals of living conditions of the urban poor
were the precursors to the culture of poverty theory and marginality theory. These
theories blamed the victims (the slum dwellers) for social evils such as prostitution and
crime (Arefi, 2009; Perlman, 1976; Weinstein, 2014).

The Culture of Poverty and Marginality theories reflected the popular misconceptions,
stereotypes, and assumed weaknesses associated with poor communities (Lewis, 1975;
Lloyd,1979; Perlman, 1976). In these theories, migrants from the countryside to the city
were perceived as maladapted to modern city life. Therefore, the slum dwellers were
responsible for their poverty and lack of decent housing due to their failure to gain formal
employment. These theories portrayed slum dwellers as the ‘other.’ i.e., not part of the
urban community and slums were seen as dens of crime, violence, prostitution and
social breakdown. Conventional wisdom suggested that the only solution to these social
problems was relocating the slum dwellers to decent housing. Popular opinion during
that era was that slums are the roots of all-evil, this view was legitimized by social
scientists and resulted in the creation and implementation of slum removal policies
(Perlman, 1976).

The ‘Rational Scientific City’ discourse was popular in the era (Perlman, 1976); slums did
not belong in the modern, rational city. Policy measures aimed at the urban poor in the
21

planning discourse ranged from segregation at one end of the spectrum, to outright slum
removal on the other end. One of the first striking examples of slum removal policy
particular to the modern rational city was Haussmann’s design of Paris. Rabé (2009)
calls this ‘Haussmannisation.'. The new Paris demolished many of the ‘wretched
quarters’ home to the urban poor, and built grand boulevards, government buildings,
parks, and squares. The newly laid out city displaced thousands of low-income
residents, but did not provide alternate housing for those residents (Rabé, 2009).

Slum removal, however, did not solely remain a French policy. The tenement laws of
New York, the 1949 and 1954 Housing Acts cleared slums across the United States as
part of a massive urban renewal program. The outmoded, worn-out, and blighted areas
were replaced with well-planned development (i.e., high-rise apartments) geared to
modern needs (Weinstein 2014). Policy makers and urban planners considered high-rise
apartments as an ideal replacement for blighted old housing and slums. Supra national
organizations such as World Bank transplanted these same policies of apartment style
high-rise housing to the developing countries without giving much thought to the differing
contexts in those countries (Pugh, 1995).

These agencies assumed that high-rise public housing would be affordable and that it
would eventually eliminate the unsanitary conditions and disorder within the slums.
These public housing policies completely disregarded the existing social, economic, and
political ties within these neighborhoods. While Europe and America are the intellectual
centers of this type of housing policy, similar slum removal policies were implemented
across the world. At the end of this phase, countries such as the US and France claimed
to have eradicated slums (like it was a disease) (Weinstein, 2008). Urban poverty still
exists in these developed countries, but researchers frame their urban poverty as
22

advanced marginality (Wacquant, 2008). In the next section, we illustrate the challenges
and pitfalls of the slum removal policy through a case study from Brazil.

Brazil’s Favela Removal: The Eradication of a Life Style
Janice Perlman’s (1976) research on favelas in Rio de Janeiro is one of the seminal
studies on the subject. As part of her research, she looked at the effects of large-scale
slum removal policies. In 1970, the Rio government demolished a favela in Catacumba
and relocated the residents to high-rise apartments on the outskirts of the city. Perlman
studied the economic, socio-cultural, political and physical impacts of the relocation.

Economic Repercussions: The new housing projects were built further away from the city
center, the women in these households could no longer work as the increased time and
expense to travel for work placed an undue burden on their families. At the same time,
the families incurred additional expenses such as mortgage payments, water, and
electric bills. Overall, the move resulted in a net loss of household income (Perlman,
1976).

Social and Cultural Repercussions: The slum dwellers were relocated based on their
income levels rather than on social and familial ties. Therefore, the informal social
networks within the favela did not survive the relocation. This move isolated the
residents from urban amenities such as movies, beaches, markets, spectator sports, etc.
These amenities were part of the urban experience that made the residents feel like a
part of the city (Perlman, 1976).

Political Repercussions: Before the move, the slum dwellers were politically active and
united in their cause to fight the relocation. After the move, the residents and their
leaders were scattered across the region, resulting in a disruption of the political
23

structure. The slum dwellers lost their political will as their failure to fight the move left
them disheartened and disenfranchised.

Physical Repercussions: The physical effects of the move were noticeably positive,
especially for children who now had access to water and sanitation. However, due to the
poor quality of construction, there were constant leaks, cracks on the walls appeared just
a few years after construction. The poor construction made the residents wary of paying
long-term mortgages on their units.

Policy Implications: Type 1 Slum redevelopment Policy
Slum removal programs even with newly built public housing projects resulted in a net
loss of low-income housing units in America, Brazil and India. By the 1960s the
academicians and the NGOs working in the slums, criticized the modernist
redevelopment strategy. First, the intended beneficiaries were no better off; these slum
redevelopments destroyed existing informal networks within the community (which are
critical for unskilled workers). In many cases, the slum dwellers were shifted to the city’s
outskirts with limited access to jobs or services. A second criticism of the public housing
approach was its flawed belief in physical determinism and its unsubstantiated
assumptions about the physical preferences of beneficiaries (Gans, 1982; Davis, 2006;
Mukhija, 2001; Rabé, 2009).

Researchers from Latin America, such as Hernando De Soto and Manuel Castells, as
well as American scholars, such as Herbert Gans and Jane Jacobs, challenged the
public housing perspective. These academics argued that marginality was a myth
employed as an instrument for the social control of the poor, and a mechanism for
collective consumption that determined the social order of the urban poor. These
24

scholars stressed that the urban poor were not ‘marginal’ or socially excluded. Rather,
they were fully integrated, but on terms that often caused them to be economically
exploited, politically repressed, socially stigmatized and culturally excluded (Alsayyad,
2004).

Type 2: Self Help (1972-1988)
The realization that slums were more of a solution than the problem resulted in a new
wave of slum redevelopment policies (Mangin, 1967; Turner, 1976). John Turner and
William Mangin’s research in Peru showed that slums develop organically with
incremental construction, and urbanize spontaneously. Scholars such as Gilbert & Ward
(1985) and Perlman (1976) presented findings from Latin America that illustrated that
slum dwellers improve their homes one brick at a time. Mangin & Turner’s research was
the precursor to the self-help programs or slum upgrading schemes; the catch phrase of
this era was: ‘helping the poor help themselves’ (Pugh, 1995; Davis, 2006).

Self-help or slum upgrading policies are a low cost alternative especially when compared
to the public housing redevelopment model (Davis, 2006; Mukhija, 2001; Pugh, 1995).
The two critical components of the self-help housing policy include tenure security and
slum upgrading. Tenure security refers to a government authorization that protects the
slum dwellers from forced eviction providing them with development rights. Slum
upgrading includes the provision of services such as water, roads, sewer, and electricity.
This self-help housing policy was a pragmatic, cost-effective approach to the urban crisis
that Robert McNamara, the president of the World Bank in the 70s favored (Davis,
2006).

25

World Bank’s Slum Upgrading Program (SUP) known as the sites and services program
is one of the best examples of this type of slum redevelopment policy. The two elements
of this program are: (1) tenure security and (2) improving access to infrastructure (roads,
water, sewer and others). World Bank increased its funding for Urban Development
projects from 10 million dollars in 1972 to more than 2 billion dollars in 1988 primarily to
encourage more sites and services programs across the world. The Bank financed 116
sites and services program in 55 countries between 1972 and 1990 (Pugh, 1995). This
was a mere drop in the bucket regarding the need, but it gave the Bank tremendous
leverage over national urban policies, as well as direct patronage relationships to local
slum communities and NGOs (Davis 2006).

Indonesia’s Kampung2 Improvement Program
The World Bank’s Sites and services program financed Indonesia’s nationally
implemented Kampung Improvement Program (KIP). The KIP significantly reduced
urban poverty and improved the quality of life of Indonesia’s urban poor (Das &
Takahashi, 2009). KIP began in Jakarta in 1969, under Indonesia’s First Five Year
Development Plan, with World Bank funds, as well as joint funding by the Government of
Indonesia and the city government of Jakarta. The goal of KIP was to improve the quality
of life in urban kampungs by providing basic physical infrastructures such as paved
footpaths and roads, drains, garbage bins and collection, and public water taps and
toilets. Improving physical conditions in the kampung would, presumably stimulate the
improvement of individual houses, and eventually, upgrade the socio-economic
characteristics of the community. Physical infrastructure was KIP’s focus for the first ten

neighborhood.

26

years, but then the program incorporated some primary health components, particularly
those aimed at children.

Over 30 years, KIP was implemented in almost 800 cities and towns across Indonesia.
The low cost and simple technology allowed for easy replication and expedited
implementation. Overall, the program was successful in reducing national poverty
substantially (Das & Takahashi, 2009). The KIP program incorporated the traditional
Indonesian societal customs of deliberation and discussion, community self-help, mutual
assistance and volunteering for community activities. It also integrated the Indonesian
culture of self-help called gotong-royong in its implementation.

Policy Implication: Self Help
The central and most vocal criticism of the self-help slum redevelopment policy comes
from Mike Davis. Davis (2006) argues that, under the guise of ‘helping the poor help
themselves,’ the state has withdrawn from its historical commitment to provide housing
for the urban poor. In addition, the cost-recovery provision of the World Bank is not
affordable to the poorest of the poor. In 1987, the bottom 30 to 60 percentile of the
population (depending on the country) did not qualify for the slum upgrading program
(Peattie, 1982). These ‘self help’ redevelopment projects were tested in Chile, Pakistan,
India, Iraq, Turkey and Colombia during the mid 1960s. But these programs failed in the
majority of those countries due to poor quality of construction, failure of infrastructure
and/or gentrification of the slum (Peattie, 1982). Other critics point to the fact that these
programs primarily focused on the housing and in the absence employment creation or
job skills training, the program failed to improve the lives of the poor (Roy, 2004).

27

Type 3: Enablement (1986-1992)
Enablement refers to the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in
devising home grown solutions to the problem of slums. In 1999, World Bank mandated
countries requesting aid to prepare Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) and
involve NGOs and advocacy groups in its preparation (Davis, 2006). Scholars called this
participatory turn of World Bank. Around the same time, NGOs such as SPARC as well
as Shack/ Slum Dwellers International (SDI) were gaining recognition in India and
internationally.

Some of these NGOs were not just drafting policy but were also implementing slum
redevelopment programs, constructing toilet blocks, conducting slum surveys, and
running micro savings groups. SPARC assisted the Markandeya slum dwellers in
Mumbai in designing and managing their slum redevelopment program (Mukhija, 2003).
This case study summarizes the institutional, physical and financial challenges that a
NGO faces when building new houses for slum dwellers.

India’s Markandeya Project
The Markandeya slum is part of Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum. In 1988, Markendeya was
selected for redevelopment under India’s Prime Minister Grant Project (PMGP). Unlike
other slum redevelopment schemes, the World Bank was not involved in this project.
Rather than allowing construction through a government agency or a for-profit company,
the residents registered a housing society (The Markandeya Cooperative Housing
Society (MCHS)), and with the support of the local NGO SPARC, built their houses. In
1998, ten years after the project started, the first of the residents moved into their new
apartments (Mukhija, 2003).

28

The construction of Markendeya project took considerably longer time than the
traditional projects due to institutional, physical and financial challenges. SPARC and
PMGP had several disputes over a ten-year redevelopment process over a number of
issues including size and number of units, as well as financial (government funding,
mandatory down payment or collateral for the loan) matters of the redevelopment.

Financing the project was challenging, although the project was eligible for a low-income
housing loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCOGovernment of India’s financing agency), the agency demanded collateral for the loan,
SPARC had to raise funds for the initial guarantee. Later in 1992, it convinced the
Belgian Foundation SELAVIP - Servicio Latino Americano y Asiatico de Vivienda Popular
- to provide HUDCO with a bank guarantee for the entire loan (Mukhija, 2003).

From a physical perspective, the project changed over time. The initial project was a lowrise building with 94 units, shared toilets, and a community terrace. Five years after the
start of construction as the cost of construction increased, SPARC & MCHS had two
options: either take out another loan at a higher interest rate or build additional market
rate units to reduce the burden on the residents. They increased the number of market
rate units by doubling the density to 198 units and constructing individual toilets to make
the market rate units more enticing to the buyers (Mukhija, 2003).

Policy Implications: Enablement
Several former critics of the self-help approach have hailed the participatory turn at the
World Bank. However, scholars such as Davis (2006) and Pugh (1995) claim that the
NGOs rather than the slum residents are the beneficiaries of the enablement approach.
These scholars (Davis, 2006; Pugh, 1995) argue that the PRSP process has
29

bureaucratized and de-radicalized urban social movements. The enablement method
consists of decentralization, demand-driven development, privatization and deregulation.
However, as seen in Markendeya case study NGOs lack the proper financial and
institutional support to implement slum redevelopment programs and significant
shortcomings exist in enablement conceptualization (Mukhija, 2001).

Supra National agencies such as World Bank assumed that decentralization increases
the scope of direct decision-making and the responsibilities of participants in the housing
delivery process, the reality is far from that assumption. The Markendeya case suggests
that decentralization for slum redevelopment may lead to conflicts related to claims on
the new assets, especially when property assets are high-value. Conflicting demands
between the government administration, and the NGOs can generate conflicts of
institutional interest (Mukhija, 2003).

Type 4: National Slum Upgrading Programs: The Cities Alliance (1992current)
Through its National Slum Upgrading program, Cities Alliance provides grants and
knowledge support to adopt city level comprehensive slum upgrading policies (Cities
Alliance, 2012). Cities Alliance is a global partnership for urban poverty reduction and
promoting the sustainable development of cities. The agency published the ‘Cities
without Slums Action Plan’, which proposed a target of improving the lives of 100 million
slum dwellers by the year 2020. This goal was subsequently incorporated into the United
Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000 as Target 11 of the Millennium Development
Goals (Cities Alliance, 2012).

30

The ‘Cities without Slums’ publication created a momentous uproar from the theoretical
circles. Academic scholars widely speculate that the reemergence of the word ‘slum’ in
UN-Habitat’s vocabulary and the Millennium Development Goals has created a
complacent political atmosphere which not only tolerates slum removal but has resulted
in slum evictions at unprecedented rates3 (Arabindoo, 2011; Gilbert, 2007, 2009, 2011;
Potts, 2011; Simon, 2011). Despite strong criticism, Cities Alliance provided support to
several countries to launch nation-wide slum removal programs (Cities Alliance, 2012).
Thailand’s Baan Makong Program, and India’s Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) are two such
Nation-wide programs, that the agency supported in the recent years.

Thailand’s Baan Mankong Program
In January 2003, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor,
the first is Baan Mankong (Secure Housing) and the second is Baan Ua Arthorn (We
Care). The Baan Mankong Program provides infrastructure subsidies and housing loans
directly to poor communities to improve their housing and essential services. The
Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) implements the Baan Mankong
Program. Under the second program (Baan Ua Arthorn), the National Housing Authority
designs, constructs and sells ready to occupy flats and houses at subsidized rates to
lower-income households who can afford ‘rent-to-own’ payments of US $25-$37 per
month(Boonyabancha, 2009).

CODI, which is a network of community organizations, controls the funding for the Baan
Makong Program. The slum dwellers design and manage the redevelopment. This

3 Between October 2004 and January 2005, 300,00-450,000 slum dwellers were evicted in Mumbai (Arabindo, 2011);

similarly 3 million slum dwellers were evicted in Delhi between 2004-2010 (Bhan, 2009); and in Africa 700,000 people
lost their homes and livelihoods or both (Potts, 2011).

31

process stimulates deeper, but less tangible changes in social structure, organizational
systems and increases confidence among poor communities (Boonyabancha, 2009).
Under Baan Makong, slum dwellers use different mechanisms such as long-term land
leases or land sharing to redevelop their community. Overall cost of the redevelopment
and the individual unit cost of housing is substantially small as the slum dwellers
themselves construct the houses, as well as negotiate to reduce the cost of land.

Baan Makong Program’s decentralized structure allows the low-income households and
their community organizations to do the upgrading. The slum dwellers with some
professional help design and build their own housing based on their individual needs.
This freedom to design and manage the redevelopment process empowers the residents
and changes their role from victims to partners in the redevelopment process.
Participation in the program enhances the status of the urban poor within the city as
important partners solving housing problems. The program strengthens the existing
social networks within the community as the residents’ partner to redevelop their
community.

India’s Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY)
In 2009, the Government launched the RAY program. RAY envisages a ‘Slum-Free
India’ with inclusive and equitable cities in which every citizen has access to basic civic
and social services and decent shelter. It aims to achieve this vision through a multipronged approach focusing on:

•

Bringing all existing slums within the formal system and enabling them to have
the same level of basic amenities as the rest of the city;

32

•

Redressing the failures of the formal system that lie behind the creation of slums,
and

•

Addressing the shortages of urban land and housing that keep shelter out of
reach of the urban poor and force them to resort to extra - legal solutions in a bid
to retain their sources of livelihood and employment (Kundu 2012).

The RAY program is visionary since it requires the cities to tackle the issue of slums
from a holistic perspective. Prior to disbursement of any funds, states and cities have to
prepare and adopt a Slum-Free Plan of Action (POA), aimed to remove all their city
slums within five years and list the steps that the city is taking to avoid the creation of
new slums. Emphasis is also given to data collection and use of technology. Cities are
required to create a GIS database of all the slums and collect household surveys, as well
as involve households during all the stages of project (i.e., in the planning,
implementation and post implementation). An important part of the RAY program is the
production of ‘data space’ the mapping, surveying and documenting of slum lands
through elaborate technologies from satellite images to ground level spatial data and
slum surveys by non-government organizations (Roy, 2014).

RAY emphasizes in-situ development. However, it gives cities the ability to identify
hazardous and objectionable slums. While hazardous slums are defined in terms of
environmental problems and health risks, objectionable slums violate legal or master
plan norms. Researchers such as Kundu (2012) argue that lack of clear criteria to
identify ‘untenable’ and ‘hazardous’ slums might result in ambiguity causing local
conflicts. However, technological solutions are available to address sanitation and
drainage issues in hazardous/objectionable sites in slums and make then tenable
(Kundu, 2012).
33

It is too early to determine whether the program is a success or a failure, but as Om
Prakash Mathur suggests, RAY and the Slum Free City are an interesting collection of
promises awaiting performance (Mathur, 2009). If the program has even limited success
in achieving its multiple objectives, it can be considered a major departure from past
practice and can therefore be heralded as a policy innovation. The funding for the
program was increased from Rs. 1.5 billion ($18.9 million) in 2009-2010 to Rs. 12.7
billion ($192.8 million) for the 2010-2011 period (Andavarapu & Edelman, 2013).

Policy Implications: National Slum Upgrading Programs
A recent review of slum redevelopment programs under the RAY Program showed that
the vast majority of the units built under the scheme were poor quality. This is a striking
similarity to the public housing problems observed in Type 1 slum redevelopment
programs. The quality of construction is a key determinate of the long-term maintenance
burden of the unit and ensures the sustainability of the development (Patel, 2013).

Many of the Indian daily newspapers reported on the poor quality of these structures.
Figure 2 illustrates the broken shutter less windows in the new houses built under the
program. The structural integrity of these buildings is questionable, as the concrete
columns are breaking apart revealing the poor quality of construction.

A second challenge of the RAY programs is that the employees at the municipal level
lack the capacity to conduct meaningful dialogue at the community level resulting in the
creation of government-funded, constructor-built, poor quality, public housing style
projects (Patel, 2013). The Baan Makong program on the other hand used creative
community participation methods to encourage the slum residents to collectively improve
the physical infrastructure of their community.
34

Under the Baan Makong program, residents collaborate with the government create cooperative housing units, design and monitor their slum redevelopment. Slum
redevelopment then became a process through which urban poor experience change as
they grasp their collective capacity as a community. Through this process, the poor
realize that they are no different from the other citizens of the city. A slum upgrading
policy needs to achieve this sense of social upgrading in addition to physical upgrading
(Boonyabancha, 2005).

Future Directions for Slum Redevelopment
The challenge of improving housing conditions for over a billion people living in slums is
a daunting task. Especially when these urban residents do not have access to essential
services such as water, sewer, roads, etc. Despite these shortcomings, millions of
people continue to move to cities in search of a better future (UN-Habitat, 2010). This
section will discuss how slum redevelopments can be more successful through small

35

incremental policy changes at the Donor level (supra-national agencies) and recipient
level (municipal government and the slum).

Donor Level Strategies
Donor agencies, such as the World Bank, the International Development Bank, the IMF
and USAID, continue to play a prominent role in slum redevelopment. Due to their vast
monetary resources, these institutions have strong negotiating power and can set policy.
These supranational agencies enact three strategies to improve the effectiveness and
successful implementation of slum redevelopment: capacity building among local
planners; comprehensive statutory reforms; and funds for social infrastructure (education
and empowerment).

Donor agencies typically focus on physical aspects of slum redevelopment and mandate
community participation as a prerequisite for these redevelopments. Community
involvement in developing countries is termed the ‘haan Ji’ (yes sir) syndrome4, where
the slum residents are often passive participants. Creative public participation methods
encourage discourse between the slum dwellers and the policy makers. Wherever
possible, existing community organizations, such as a women’s savings group or local
institutions, should be used to engage the public. However, many cities and countries
lack the capacity both regarding the number of planners available, as well as adequate
training to conduct meaningful community participation. Therefore, finances for capacity
building and exchanges (sharing knowledge and experience) can significantly increase
the output of a redevelopment program (Patel, 2013).

36

Donor agencies can also encourage local and state governments to implement
comprehensive legislative reforms. Many public authorities lack the legislative framework
to structure and implement slum improvements. A comprehensive legislative framework
can give these agencies a process to follow, the powers to cut through accumulated
revenue and planning related regulatory tangles, and the authority to be able to
adjudicate between and compensate claimants to resolve tenure disputes. The key to
scaling-up is to institute a comprehensive statutory framework, embedded in powerful
state-level legislation, that public agencies can use to structure and implement contextspecific slum - improvement schemes (Patel, 2013). Donor agencies should mandate
and fund comprehensive legislative reforms.

Donor agencies should give equal priority to physical and social infrastructure of the
slum dwellers. Slum redevelopments need to address the underlying issues within the
slum such as poverty, education, and health care. These redevelopment policies also
need to take into account how they will affect the informal networks within the
community, which play a vital role in the daily lives of the slum residents.

Recipient Level Strategies
The local and state governments receive funds from supra-national agencies to
implement slum redevelopment programs. These agencies have multiple responsibilities
and lack the expertise or tools to effectively implement slum redevelopments policies.
State and local government often tend to focus on the short-term physical improvements
in a slum, since those improvements are measurable. However, a long-term
transformation in the lives of slum dwellers can only be achieved through a combination
of physical and social improvement and a genuine partnership with the slum dwellers.
The underlying aim of slum upgrading is improving the quality of life of the residents. If
37

the slum redevelopment results in reduced incomes and breaks the social networks,
then the slum redevelopment can be considered a failure despite any physical
improvements.

Slum redevelopments should improve the physical (roads, water, sewer, and electricity)
and social (education, empowerment and informal networks) infrastructure of the
community. Type 3 (Enablement) and some of Type 4 (eg: Baan Makong Program) slum
redevelopment strategies have successfully improved both the physical and social
infrastructure of the slum dwellers. It is therefore possible to transform the lives of the
slum resident but only when they are real partners in the redevelopment process.

Conclusion
This chapter analyzed the four types of slum redevelopment models used across the
world over the past several decades. The chronological narrative of policy brings to light
the similarities and differences between the Type 1 and Type 4 slum redevelopment
policies (Table 1).

The Type 1 and Type 2 slum redevelopment policies envisioned a perfect city, a bustling
metropolis where there are no poor and no slums. During the 1950s it was the vision to
create a rational scientific city (such as Haussmann’s Paris or Burnham’s White City in
Chicago). Rational scientific city discourse refers to the practical scientific system of
planning and zoning with density requirements and separation of uses. The unsanitary
and disorderly slums were not part of the rational scientific city. The Type 1 slum
redevelopment policies recommended the demolition of slums and replacing them with
multi-level apartment buildings (Pugh, 1995). Today, the vision of ‘world-class city’
motivates the policy makers in developing countries like India. Slums/ slum dwellers are
38

not part of this ‘world class city' vision, and nation-wide slum redevelopment policies
envision slum free cities (Ghertner, 2010).

The second common theme between these two slum redevelopment policies is their
emphasis on apartment style high-rise buildings for slum dwellers. The high-rise living
does not allow for, street level interactions and access to open space, which are critical
aspects of social life in slums. The pursuit of physical infrastructure at the cost of social
upgrading does not improve the overall quality of life of the urban poor. Another
challenge of these apartment style living is the poor construction quality and lack of
oversight during construction.

The third theme is that of finances. Finances were the limiting factor for Type 1 slum
redevelopment policies. Since the central government was funding these developments
the Type 1 redevelopment model had limited applicability in the developing world.
However, a new financial model of urban development, the public-private partnership
(PPP) model allows governments to fund large-scale urban renewal programs with little
to no investment up front (Goldman, 2011). Therefore, Type 4 redevelopment policy has
more reach across the developing world.

39

Lessons learned and forgotten
As the rhetoric of the slum-free cities is returning to the mainstream policy discourse, it is
imperative to revisit and glean lessons from the past experiences. In ‘Myth of Marginality’
Perlman (1976), documents the economic, social, political and physical impacts of slum
demolition. Residents of Catacumba slum in Rio were forcibly evicted in 1970s and
placed in public housing at the edge of the city. One of the positive aspects of the move
was improved access to water and sanitation, which resulted in dramatic health
improvements for the residents especially children. However, the poor quality
construction led to leaks and cracks, causing long term maintenance issues for the
inhabitants. Economically, the move resulted in a net loss of household income: due to
increased cost of transportation, and new expenses such as mortgage, electric, water
and other utilities. Social networks of the community were disrupted, resulting in an
increased distrust and crime within in the community. After their forcible eviction, the
slum dwellers no longer saw the system as benign and lost their political will to
participate.

Many of the issues that Perlman reported in 1970s, such as poor quality construction,
lack of public input, ignoring social and cultural values were evident in the several slum
redevelopment efforts undertaken through the RAY program (Patel, 2013). Slum
redevelopment is essential. However, previous experiences illustrate that these
redevelopments can improve the quality of life for the slum dwellers only if they are
partners in the transformation.

40

RAY mandates public participation and collaboration with the slum residents as part of
their slum redevelopment strategy. However, the local governments implementing these
redevelopments lack the capacity to conduct meaningful dialogue with the slum
residents. In addition to the physical redevelopment of slums, RAY addresses
institutional changes to facilitate slum redevelopment. For example, states requesting
funding under the program have to create a legislative framework granting land tenure to
the slum residents.

RAY program facilitates public-private investment in slum redevelopments and above all
cities participating in RAY are required to conduct a household survey of all the slums in
their cities and map the slums using a GIS shape file. The RAY program is empowering
the slum dwellers through mapping their slums. The central question however is whether
these policies will create an inclusive society where the poor have access to physical
(road, water, and sewer) and social infrastructure (education, empowerment, and
informal social networks).

41

Chapter 2: Resilience and Slums: An Etymological Journey
Chapter 1 explored how slums are fast becoming a core feature of urbanization in the
global south and narrated the changing academic and political discourse on slums over
the years. Conceptualizing slums as resilient enclaves provides an opportunity to
change the narrative on slum dwellers from victims to survivors. This chapter aims to
provide a systematic overview of urban resilience literature and its relevance to slums.
Holling (1973) first proposed the theory of resilience that challenged the command and
control approaches to ecosystem management advocated by the ecologists of the time.
Holling (1973) dismissed the idea that ecosystems organize around a single equilibrium
point to which a system will automatically return following a disaster. After its initial
introduction in ecological thinking, resilience gained tremendous traction and prominence
across several disciplines such as disaster aid, climate change, and urban planning.

Resilience tends to shift deep-rooted paradigms. For example, in the field of Climate
Change, the conversation has moved from adaptation to resilience and transformation,
where the emphasis is not adapting to climate change, but transforming cities to respond
better to crises (Pelling & Manuel-navarrete, 2011; Satterthwaite & Dodman, 2013). In
disaster recovery, the conversation moves from vulnerability and panic to a phenomenon
known as the “resilient population,” which refers to the well-documented phenomenon of
widespread cooperation--even altruism that often manifests during disasters (Zebrowski,
2013). Social norms, far from breaking down, not only continue to govern behavior but
also prove remarkably resilient with incidences of violence and crime often subsiding
significantly (Zebrowski, 2013).

The empirical evidence from slums across the world demonstrates that even when
equipped with crippling infrastructure, limited monetary resources, and unresponsive
42

governments, slum dwellers use their social networks (bonding and bridging
connections) to survive extraordinary conditions. Slum dwellers out of necessity form a
sense of community due to the limited scope of municipal administration and the
challenges of everyday life. The outcome is a high degree of social cohesion, as well as
robust forms of self-organization, self-regulation, and self-reliance. However, the
transformative resilience of slums, which refers to long-term physical and social
transformation, is only feasible when residents build linking networks with external
agencies such as the non-government or government agencies. Theoretical and
empirical evidence presented in this chapter illustrate that transformative resilience of
slum dwellers is the least explored areas of research. This Chapter proposes three
research questions to study the transformative resilience of slums:

•

What are the disasters that slum dwellers face and survive? (Temporal Perspective)

•

Why do slum dwellers fight for their community as their turf? (Spatial Perspective)

•

How do slum dwellers with meager resources survive disasters? (Social Perspective)

Six definitions of resilience
The notions of urban resilience and the resilient city have gained considerable attention
and interest over the recent years, not only concerning environmental management, but
also regarding urban planning. Urban resilience has expanded beyond academic
discourse and is increasingly prevalent in public policy documents. As is evident through
the multiple interpretations of the term, definition of resilience is still quite fuzzy. In this
section, six definitions of resilience are discussed and evaluated:

“Engineering Resilience” refers to the ability of a system to return to equilibrium or a
steady state after a disturbance. The emphasis is on return time, efficiency, constancy,
43

and predictability (Campanella, 2006). Although disaster studies embrace this static
engineering based conceptualization of resilience, it is not appropriate in the context of
slums. Since the original state of slums, especially the physical aspects, such as
housing, water, and sanitation, might not be a desirable state that one wants to return.

“Equilibrium resilience” consists of two types: ‘equilibrium’ or reverting to a previous
status; and ‘non-equilibrium’ or pursuing a preferred option (Pickett et al, 2004). The
non-equilibrium view of resilience is more dynamic and evolutionary (Arefi, 2011). Under
the non-equilibrium paradigm, resilience demonstrates the ability of a system to adapt
and adjust to changing internal or external processes. The emphasis is not to reach or
maintain a certain end point or a terminal condition, but to stay in the game. This
definition of resilience promotes flexibility by focusing on form, function, and flow of the
built environment (Arefi, 2011). In an urban context “form” refers to buildings; “function”
reflects purpose; and “flow” represents the movement of information, services, and
people. This definition of resilience can be particularly relevant for studying slums since it
incorporates the process of change. The definition, however, is not holistic and does not
consider the long-term challenges that the slum dwellers face.

“Evolutionary resilience” challenges the whole notion of equilibrium and suggests that it
is like the system to evolve and change with or without external disturbances (Davoudi,
Brooks, & Mehmood, 2013). This definition has some validity in the context of slums
since they do evolve over time and adapt to changing conditions. Nevertheless, this
definition does not take into consideration the severity of natural (fire/flood) or man-made
(eviction/redevelopment) threats that slum dwellers face.

44

“Community resilience” refers to the development of personal and collective capacities of
communities to respond and influence change to sustain and renew the community
(Magis, 2010). Residents of poor communities, especially informal settlements invest
time and energy to develop community resilience to fight against external threats such
as eviction or flooding. Although this definition emphasizes the social capital, it does not
contemplate the severity of external threats that the slum dwellers face. This definition
assumes incorrectly that the communities have adequate resources to survive or rebuild
after disasters.

“Adaptive cycle framework” (figure 3) posits that socio-ecological systems go through
four phases of development in their life cycle (Gunderson & Holling, 2002). They are
growth/exploitation, conservation, release/creative destruction, and reorganization.
Informal settlements are vital ecosystems that evolve over the years and adapt to natural
(fire/flood) or man-made (eviction/crime) threats using their social capital. The adaptive
cycle framework studies these transformations over time (Dovey, 2012).

Dovey (2012) applied this framework to informal settlements and argues that the growth
phase (r) begins when the slum dwellers build the first hut on a vacant land.
Conservation phase (K) commences as the slum residents start improving their
community and add permanent structures. Residents create new norms and networks
for their community, and over time strengthen their social capital. They build new
linkages with external agencies. Informal settlements can continue at this stage for a
long time, but in some cases, these communities face a manmade or natural disaster,
which will be the release (Ω) phase. The reorganization (α) phase refers to the ordeal
after the creative destruction and a new regime begins to appear. During this phase, the
community’s social capital is tested: the residents may use their linkage capital to
45

formalize their slums and gain tenure security; in the case of a natural disaster such as
flood/ fire, the residents may choose to rebuild their community collectively. On the
contrary, during this phase, the residents can be displaced or the settlement can spiral
downward and stabilize as a dangerous slum (Dovey 2012).

“Social Resilience” (table 2), comprises three dimensions, coping, adaptive and
transformative capacities (Keck & Sakdapolrak, 2013). The coping capacity refers to
activities that residents take immediately after the disaster. These activities are short
term and will at the maximum restore the community to pre-disaster levels. The coping
capacity of the urban poor is rooted in their perseverance in enduring hardship whether
this takes the form of everyday crises due to irregular incomes or ill health, or an
extraordinary situation such as floods, fire, eviction or other such disasters. Slum
dwellers use readily accessible resources to cope with and overcome particular threats
or disasters (Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Keck & Sakdapolrak, 2013).

Adaptive capacity refers to activities conducted in preparation for an impending disaster.
Individuals and communities use their past experiences to anticipate risks, and their
ability to mobilize support from within the community or through other reciprocal network
relations to prepare in advance. Adaptive Capacity reflects the residents’ abilities to
adapt flexibly to their livelihoods, or business strategies in light of stress and shocks
(Keck & Etzold, 2013).

Transformative capacity addresses the ability of a system to transform and create new
pathways when ecological, economic or social structures make the existing system
unbearable (Keck & Sakdapolrak, 2013). While the coping and adaptive capacities of
communities focus on the internal structures of the community, the third dimension
transformative resilience focuses on crafting institutions that foster individual welfare and
sustainable societal robustness in the event of present and future crises. Slum
transformations also have to address social issues such as equality, justice, and human
rights, which have been at the heart and center of the slum debate, issues (Keck &
Sakdapolrak, 2013; Roy, 2014). Viewed in this way, the search for ways to build
resilience in the lives of the poor and marginalized is not only a technical issue, but also
a political issue.

47

Slums and slum dwellers face severe natural or manmade threats in short, mid, or long
term. Residents use their social capital to adapt to these external threats. For example,
in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami in Tamil Nadu (short-term), communities
with strong social capital implemented faster recoveries (Aldrich, 2011). Communities
with direct connections with external agencies had access to aid quickly and distributed
them efficiently among the residents. When faced with redevelopment and eviction
threats (mid-term), Dharavi and Sanjay Gandhi Nagar slums in Mumbai used their
linkages with external agencies to emerge into resilient systems (Neuwirth, 2006;
Weinstein, 2014). Tomang and Mangarrai slums in Jakarta are in the flood zone and are
regularly flooded. The residents of these slums developed informal warning systems
using their social networks and created policies to protect their communities from looting
and destruction (long-term) (Wilhelm, 2011).

Table 3, evaluates the six definitions of resilience based on three criteria: is the definition
applicable to short-term, mid-term and long-term challenges that slum dwellers face;
does the definition acknowledge that some of the threats can devastate slums; finally
does the definition incorporate the role of social capital in the ongoing resilience of
communities.

Both the adaptive cycle and the social resilience definitions are ideal for studying the
resilience of slums (table 3). Both definitions consider the short, mid-term and long-term
challenges that slum dwellers face on an ongoing basis. The four phases of adaptive
cycle framework allow us to study the constant transformations occurring in these
settlements. The ‘release’ phase (figure 3) demonstrates the severity of external threats
that these communities face. The reorganization phase recognizes the ability of slum
dwellers to engage their social capital and emerge into new resilient systems. Similarly,
48

the coping and adaptive capacities outlined in the social resilience address the
challenges that these communities face.

Despite its strengths, the adaptive cycle model is meant to study eco-systems. Slums
however are much more complex than eco-systems. Dovey (2012) calls slum, ‘complex
adaptive assemblages’ since the social, economical and ecological inter-linkages among
the residents are much more complex and organic than any other eco-system.
Additionally, the three dimensions of social resilience (coping, adaptive, and
transformative) view at the capacity of the slum dwellers to fight challenges as opposed
to the resilience of the system as a whole. Therefore, social resilience provides a better
theoretical model to study resilience of slum dwellers.

Social Resilience and Social Capital
Slum dwellers often rely on their informal social networks to cope and adapt to a
disaster. However, slum dwellers need external help to transform to a better physical or
social standing. The three principal originators (Bourdieu, Coleman, and Putnam) of
social capital had entirely different epistemological approaches to the concept. Bourdieu
49

views social capital as a ‘good’ consciously maintained by those in power to retain the
social divisions. Coleman conceives social capital as an unintended outcome of social
processes and interaction. Putnam’s definition, which is the most popular, frames social
capital as, ‘features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that
facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit’. Putnam’s definition
differentiates three elements of social capital—norms, social values/trust, and networks.
Even with the diverse roots and contradictory interpretations, social capital has rapidly
grown to prominence in a wide range of disciplines such as social policy including
economic development, health, education, regeneration, community development and
poverty alleviation (Adger, 2012; Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Pelling & High, 2005). This
dissertation uses Putnam’s definition of social capital, primarily the three forms of social
capital: bonding, bridging and linking (Putnam, 2000).

Bonding ties are networks between individuals who share the same ethnic and religious
identities. These links typically represent relationships between immediate family
members and relatives (the in-laws, their sons, and daughters) (Putnam, 2000). Pelling
& High (2005, p 310) describe bridging networks as, ‘social relations of exchange, often
of association between people with shared interest or goals but contrasting social
identity’. Bonding and bridging relationships represent the internal horizontal linkages
within the community (Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Pelling & High, 2005). These horizontal
linkages provide strong support for communities to cope and adapt to disasters.

Linking ties are a subcategory of bridging ties; these relationships cross group
boundaries in a vertical direction. Linking networks provide political, economic, or
knowledge-based support to slum residents. They provide the community with muchneeded resources not just to recover and bounce back but also transform the
50

communities to a better physical state. The bonding/bridging/linking triplet provides an
appropriate framework to study social capital in the context of slums.

As seen in table 4, the three categories of social capital (bonding, bridging and linking)
are organically integrated with the three dimensions of social resilience (coping, adapting
and transforming). Coping strategies often rely on strong bonding between the residents.
These strategies include sharing food and shelter (Chatterjee, 2010; Keck & Etzold,
2013; Wilhelm, 2011); gaining mutual comfort through religious gatherings (Braun &
Aßheuer, 2011; Islam & Walkerden, 2014); and more importantly searching and rescuing
their friends and family members (Ajibade, McBean, & Bezner-Kerr, 2013; Islam &
Walkerden, 2014; Wilhelm, 2011).

Similarly, many of the adaptive practices are low-cost, homemade measures that are put
in place before the disaster to reduce its impact. These adaptive methods often rely on
the bonding and bridging capital of the slum residents. For example, slum residents
work together to widen and cover the drains (Chatterjee, 2010; Jabeen, Johnson, &
51

Allen, 2010); establish security system among residents to prevent looting (Jabeen et al.,
2010; Wilhelm, 2011); pool resources so the evacuees have access to food and water
(Wilhelm, 2011); maintain close relations with local grocer so that they can secure food
at credit (Keck & Etzold, 2013). In the case of Jakarta’s recurring floods, the residents
created bridging networks with municipal employees who operate the floodgates, and
with relatives/friends upstream to create an informal warning system in case of a flood
(Wilhelm, 2011).

Transformative capacity refers to slum redevelopment with or without a disaster. While
coping and adaptive capacities rely on the bonding and bridging networks of the slum
dwellers, transformative resilience relies on the slum dwellers’ ability to link to or connect
with external agencies. As seen chapter 1, multiple slum redevelopment policies were
implemented over the years each policy had its own challenges. Often, slum
redevelopments fail either due to poor quality construction, disruption of social networks
or gentrification after the redevelopment (Andavarapu and Edelman, 2013; Appadurai,
2001; Arefi, 2011; Dovey, 2012; Rabé, 2009; Roy, 2014).

Social Resilience – Social Capital- Empirical knowledge
Tables 5, 6 and 7 in this section provide empirical evidence to strengthen the argument
that the three forms of resilience (coping, adaptive and transformative) integrate
organically with the three forms of social capital (bonding, bridging and linking). The
three tables have the same format. The first column describes slum dwellers actions
when they face a disaster; the second column refers to the geographic location, disaster
and bibliographic reference. The first-row summarizes the individual /households actions
(bonding capital); the second row refers to the neighborhood level activities (bridging

52

capital) and the third-row outlines the government or non-government organization
responses (linking capital).

When floods or disasters occur without warning slum dwellers use a variety of measures
to cope with the disasters. Individuals and families are forced to take drastic measures,
such as reducing food intake, selling assets and taking high-interest loans (Keck &
Etzold, 2013; Chatterjee, 2010; Ajibade & McBean, 2014). Although, these measures are
destructive in the long run they are the only recourse available to the families in the
immediate aftermath of a disaster.

Community level coping/recovery efforts in the aftermath of a disaster include (table 5):
friends and neighbors searching for missing people, rescuing young and elderly, sharing
food and comfort when those resources are dwindling ( Ajibade & McBean, 2014; Islam
& Walkerden, 2014; Chatterjee 2011; Keck & Sakdapolrak 2013; Wilhelm 2011; Braun &
Aßheuer, 2011). Communities with high reserves of bonding and bridging ties have more
effective coping strategies since residents develop stronger emotional and social ties.

While poorly educated slum dwellers are typically vulnerable to external shocks, they still
show an extraordinary capacity to cope with calamities. The efforts of the slum dwellers
are vital in the aftermath of a disaster, since institutional relief of goods and other forms
of government or private assistance are typically not widely available or accessible to
them (Braun& Aßheuer 2011; Chatterjee 2010).

Adaptive capacity (table 6) refers to slum dwellers’ proactive practices or preparations
before disaster strikes (fire, flood or eviction). These practices are low-cost, crude
techniques to reduce the disaster impact. Slum residents work together to widen and
cover the drains (Chatterjee 2010) or establish security systems to prevent looting
(Wilhelm 2011). The residents pool resources to ensure access to food and water during
and immediately after the disaster (Wilhelm, 2011). During a food crises, the residents
54

maintained close relations with the local grocer to access food at credit (Keck & Etzold
2013). In Jakarta, residents in slums that are prone to flooding created informal warning
system by networking with floodgate operators and relatives/friends living upstream
(Wilhelm 2011).

This research (Ajibade et al. 2013; Wilhelm 2011; Braun & Aßheuer 2011; Chatterjee
2010; Jabeen etal, 2010; Keck & Etzold 2013; Islam & Walkerden 2014; Pelling & High
2005) suggests that the slum dwellers’ bonding & bridging capital plays a significant role
in coping and adapting with disasters. Regardless of the disaster’s magnitude, mutual
help and support are dominant features in times of crises.

Tables 5 and 6 illustrate that slum dwellers rely on bonding and bridging capital to cope
or adapt to natural/man-made disasters. The bonding and bridging social capital
however, has its limits, people can only share as long as they have enough to survive.
Bonding and bridging networks tend to crumble in the long term due to poverty and
resource limitations. The literature on resilience and slums is narrowly focused on
bouncing back to the original status quo of the residents, with minimal attention to
improving their quality of life (Chatterjee, 2010).

The third dimension of resilience, transformation implies either physical or social
transformation. Physical transformation refers to redevelopment efforts where services
such as roads, water, sewer and electricity are extended into slums and permanent
houses are build. These transformations are only feasible through government
involvement or through capital investment in the community. Transformative capacity
represents the slum’s transition to a more prosperous mode. Slum dwellers, who are
often poor and uneducated lack resources to transition into a better regime without help
from external organizations (Islam & Walkerden 2014; Aldrich 2011). Linking ties
constitute vertical cross-group boundaries (among the residents and government or nongovernment organizations). These networks can provide political, economic, or
knowledge-based support to residents, and often provide the residents with much

56

needed resources not just to recover and bounce back, but also to transform to a better
physical state.

Table 7, lists the cases where certain slums did transform to a better state. As seen in
the table, these transformations were only possible through community level bridging
networks and through linkages with external agencies. Simple explanation is that the
urban poor communities do not possess the required monetary capacity or knowledge to
improve the physical or social landscape of their communities. The examples in table 7
show that transformations occur when there is a direct connection or link to an external
government or non-government agency.

Conclusion
This chapter presented a resilient slums framework by integrating three aspects of
resilience (coping, adapting and transforming) with three aspects of social capital
(bonding, bridging and linking). Figure 4 summarizes the proposed resilient slums
framework. As seen here, when disaster strikes a slum, the first phases are coping and
adapting where the recovery is based on the engineering resilience view (i.e., bouncing
back to a normal safe state after, for example, a flood). Slum recovery in the aftermath of
57

a disaster is often left to the slum dwellers since the recovery workers do not reach the
slum on time, or in some cases, the relief network does not exist in those cities. In cases
when slum residents are aware of an imminent disaster, the residents use low-cost,
crude measures to reduce or mitigate the impact. However, transformative capacity
refers to slum redevelopment. Slum redevelopments are highly contentious, since they
are often poorly built, and if constructed well, they are prone to gentrification
(Andavarapu & Edelman 2013; Peattie 1982; Patel 2013). The social transformation of
slums reflects educating and empowering people, which is possible if initiated or
facilitated by government or non-government agencies. A slum’s physical or social
transformation is therefore only possible through connecting with government or nongovernment organizations ( Patel 2013; Islam & Walkerden 2014).

Scholars and western media often portray urban poor as vulnerable victims. However,
the empirical research presented in this chapter demonstrates that slum dwellers are
extremely resourceful and try to protect their community in the midst of natural disasters.
These residents rely heavily on their horizontal networks (bonding & bridging) to prepare
and survive challenges. Nevertheless, these horizontal networks cannot provide longterm support and can break under stressful situations. The urban poor need the
adequate connections to external agencies with knowledge and power, to improve the
physical or social standing of their community.

The linking capital or the vertical

connections to the people with power will provide these communities with the required
knowledge, tools and resources to improve their quality of life. While there is an
abundance of articles or research that deal with the short-term coping or adapting
capacities of slum dwellers. There is limited research on the long-term or transformative

58

capacity of the slum dwellers. Future research on slums needs to observe and study
transformative resilience in slums.

Chapter 3: Operationalizing Resilience
In the previous chapter, three research questions were formulated regarding the
transformative resilience of slum. This chapter will operationalize resilience and identify a
slum that has not merely coped and adapted to disasters but has transformed physically
and socially. The first section will provide background on the City of Visakhapatnam, the
research site. The subsequent sections operationalize transformative resilience and
outline the criteria for identifying a resilient slum in Visakhapatnam. The conclusion will
briefly discuss the physical and social attributes of the Pedda-Jalaripeta slum.

Visakhapatnam: A Boom Town in India
Visakhapatnam (figure 5) is the largest city in the State of Andhra Pradesh with a
population of 1.7 million residents. Visakhapatnam is the research city for two reasons:
per the 2011 Indian census, the city of Visakhapatnam has the highest percentage of
residents living in slums. 44.1%, i.e., 770,971 residents live in the 654 slums in the city.
The author is a native of Visakhapatnam and is fluent (spoken and written) in the local
language (Telugu), which are critical for the proposed qualitative ethnographic study.

Visakhapatnam (also known as Vizag) is on India’s eastern seaboard in the state of
Andhra Pradesh, approximately equidistant from Calcutta to the North and Chennai
(previously Madras) to the south. This beautiful city is said to have derived its name from
the deity ‘Visakha’-the God of Valour. The history of the town can be traced back to
Ashoka the Great (273-232 B.C) when Visakhapatnam was a small fishing village of the
Kalinga Empire. Later on, this port town successively passed from the Andhra Kings of
Vengi to the Pallavas, Cholas, and the Gangas in the 15th century Visakhapatnam
became a part of Vijayanagar Empire. The British took charge of the city and
60

transformed it into a busy and flourishing port town. Today the city has emerged as an
important port on the east coast of India. The Vizag port handles the maximum cargo in
India and promises to become one of Asia’s major ports (GVMC, 2012).

Figure 5: Location Map of City of Visakhapatnam

Visakhapatnam is growing faster than any other city in the state of Andhra Pradesh over
the past two decades. Between 1991-2001, Visakhapatnam’s population increased
faster than other Indian cities, like Mumbai, Kolkatta, Chennai and Hyderabad (Amis &
Kumar, 2000). An essential feature of population growth in the city of Visakhapatnam is
that the people living in surrounding areas, especially from the rural areas are migrating
to the city of Visakhapatnam in search of livelihoods owing to the rapid fast growth of
industrialization in the city (GVMC, 2012).

61

The city is experiencing tremendous economic growth. The sectors contributing to city’s
economic growth are agriculture and fishing (primary sector), large, medium and smallscale industries (secondary sector) and services (tertiary sector) that include trade and
commerce, transport, telecommunications, management and consultancy services,
education, etc. The export value of Indian fishing products is millions of dollars, 70% of
those export come from Andhra Pradesh (A.P), and a significant portion of this product
comes from Visakhapatnam. Around 600,000 people in the A.P. depend on fishing trade;
a quarter of that population dependent on fishing lives in Visakhapatnam.

The city faced rapid industrialization with the onset of major industries such as Oil
Refinery—a private sector fertilizer factory, Hindustan Zinc Smelter and Visakhapatnam
Steel Plant. The construction of the outer harbor and Steel Plant has considerably
changed the character of the city. On account of rapid industrialization, there has been a
tremendous amount of migration into the city. Today the tourism, services, and
information technology contribute significantly to the economy.

Visakhapatnam is the fifth fastest growing “industrial metropolis” in the Asian
subcontinent and the fastest growing industrial city on the East coast of India
strategically located midway between Calcutta and Chennai (GVMC, 2012). The
geographical advantage of a natural harbor and bountiful infrastructural facilities helped
the city acquire industrial importance and recognition in the international market. The
ideal industrial climate has led to the development of core industries. Several factors
such as: Rich deposits of iron and aluminum ores nearby; Rail and road connectivity;
and export-oriented zones and export-import parks present exciting possibilities for
setting up major industries. The basic requirements, which are necessary for
establishing an industry, are the power supply, raw materials, and transportation
62

facilities, etc. are available in Visakhapatnam. The city is home to large industrial parks
such as- Hindustan Ship Yard, Bharat Heavy Plates and Vessels factory and such other.
Nearly 200,000 workers on any given day can be employed in the City of Visakhapatnam
(GVMC, 2012).

Despite the increased economic growth, the Visakhapatnam region is characterized by a
very significant presence of the urban poor, with a growing poverty profile. Slum
settlements have multiplied over decades, and the living conditions of the poor have not
improved. The environmental decline, vehicular pollution, inadequate basic services and
infrastructure in the impoverished settlements hit the poor hardest. Nearly half of the
city’s population (770,000) lives in slums. Slums are spread across the city and
surrounding areas, with high population densities. Nearly half of the slums are on GVMC
and Government lands, and the rest of lands belonging to various public entities.

The Visakhapatnam Slum Improvement Project (VSIP), implemented with 9 million
pound funding from Department for International Development of the United Kingdom
during 1988-1996, improved the service provision to about 200,000 slum residents in the
city. This slum upgrading initiative was successful within its specific objectives. However,
it only worked in “notified” slums of the city and did not encourage a citywide assessment
of need, or any leveraging of additional funds e.g. cost sharing, etc. (Amis & Kumar,
2000). VSIP left many poor settlements in the city untouched, and only partially covered
some other slums. VSIP did not work to improve municipal management or finances
(Abelson, 1996; Amis & Kumar, 2000).

63

Operationalizing Resilience
Slum redevelopments can be resilient when they create an atmosphere for individual
growth without interrupting the existing social networks, or ecological resources. The
literature review identified that four forms of capital (physical, human, social, and
ecological) are critical for resilient slums (Adger, 2012; Andavarapu and Edelman, 2013;
Arefi, 2009; Perlman, 1976; Roy, 2003). The physical capital refers to infrastructure,
i.e., water, sewer, roads, and electricity. Access to educational services (schools,
anganwadis), and hospitals supports human enrichment. Social capital includes the
social networks within and outside the community. Resources such as fishing, urban
forest, and life stock represent ecological capital.

Since the purpose of this dissertation is to analyze transformative resilience in slums, the
first goal is to identify a slum in Visakhapatnam, with healthy stocks of physical, social,
human and ecological capital. Scholarly publications, newspaper articles and an online
database on the status of slums in the City of Visakhapatnam (GVMC, 2009) was
reviewed. This database included a location map of all the 654 slums in the city, the size
of the slums, and household surveys of all the slum residents. The data also includes
information about the physical infrastructure of slums, as well as the demographic and
economic status of the slum dwellers. A systematic review of the database on slums in
Visakhapatnam reveals that the Pedda Jalaripeta (PJ) slum-- the largest (6,000
residents) and oldest slum in the city-- had healthy stocks of physical, social, human and
ecological capital.

64

Pedda-Jalaripeta (PJ)
Pedda Jalaripeta slum is the largest and oldest slum in the city of Visakhapatnam. The
slum has a little over 7,000 people living on roughly 32 acres. An area that is one-sixth
the size of University of Cincinnati’s Campus. At a density that is double the densities of
Cincinnati’s Uptown Neighborhoods such as Over-the-Rhine or Downtown Cincinnati.
PJ is a stone throw away from luxurious five-star hotels; high-rise apartments and tourist
destinations surround PJ. PJ is next to some of the most expensive real estate in the
city, Lawsons Bay Colony. Its primary access road is Beach Road, which is the scenic
view corridor of the city and is home to several high-end apartments and shopping
areas.

Nearly all (92.9%) the houses in the PJ are located along paved roads, and all the
residents have electricity connections. 75% of households have access to tap water, and
less than 50% have pour-flush toilets on premises. This data demonstrates that the PJ
has access to necessary infrastructure (Physical capital) (GVMC, 2009). The slum also
has access to educational services (Anganwadis and schools) and health-care (Human
capital). The PJ has a publicly accessible beach (Ecological capital), which provides
livelihood (fishing) to 75% of the PJ residents (figure 3) (Immanuell & Rao, 2012). The
1980s slum redevelopment did not displace any of the residents, retaining and
strengthening the original social networks (Equations, 2008; Philipose, 2013).

65

Based on a 2009 household survey of the slum (GVMC, 2009), Pedda Jalaripeta has
3662 households. Although physically it is located in the City of Visakhapatnam, it
maintains its integrity as a fishing village. Fishing is still one of the primary source of
income for the households. The men in the slum fish using small boats and nets, while
the women walk 5-7 km (3-4.5 miles) with head loads of fish to the city’s fish market. The
slum is in proximity to amenities such as the post office, a bus stop, banks and other city
services (Muralidharan, 2013).

The majority (73 %) of the households in the slum are male-headed households (GVMC,
2009). Only 14.8% of the households have a patta or possession certificate while
another 15% have some form of rights or documents, but nearly 47% of the residents
are living on encroached government or private land. Based on these facts, the Pedda
Jalaripeta community is a mix of development and neglect. While the majority of the
residents have access to basic amenities such as water, sewer, and electricity, they still
do not possess tenure security.

This dissertation looks at the PJ's resilience from three different perspectives, temporal,
spatial and social. Temporal resilience refers to the community's ability to survive
multiple challenges over the past 30 years and retain its identity as a low-income fishing
village. Spatial resilience relates to the communities spatial resources, and social
resilience identifies PJ's social capital.

So is the survival of PJ in the midst of this glamor just luck. No like any other slum, the
PJ survived multiple disasters over the past three decades. In 1983, PJ had 800 huts,
600 of those were burned to the ground when a fire spread through the slum. The
community was devastated. The GVMC redeveloped the PJ in 1984 through the
66

Visakhapatnam Slum Improvement Program (VSIP). As seen in Chapter 2, slum
redevelopments often fail either due to low-quality construction or middle or high-income
residents gentrify them.

The PJ is one of the very few slum redevelopment success stories since the slum
continues to provide quality affordable housing three decades after the original
development. There is one reason for the successful redevelopment, Mr. Olisetty
Chinnaya. Mr.Chinnayya, a fisherman from PJ, was the elected representative of the
region during the redevelopment. He used his influence and appointed the slum’s Grama
Sabha, as the neighborhood committee in charge of monitoring the construction and
allocating the lots. This vertical linkage between the local leadership and a powerful
politician allowed for a successful redevelopment. This linkage allowed the community to
continue providing the affordable quality housing 30 years after the redevelopment.
After the redevelopment, the PJ faced other challenges like cyclones and the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami but its most formidable challenge came in the year 2000.

At the beginning of 2000, PJ witnessed an avalanche of tourism-oriented projects, these
projects not only had the potential to gentrify the PJ but, more importantly, they
threatened the livelihood of the residents (fishing). The slum residents especially the
younger fishermen thwarted those attempts through media outreach and legal filings
when necessary. Action Aid, an international aid organization, provided these fishermen
with the knowledge and resources to fight against gentrification. Once again a vertical
linkage between the youth leadership and an international aid organization provided the
knowledge and resources to combat external threats.

67

This dissertation has three findings each of these findings is elaborate in a separate
chapter. The temporal perspective chapter (Chapter 5) addresses the ‘Resilience to
What?’ question. This chapter will narrate the history of the PJ and its ability to retain its
identity as a low-income fishing village in the midst of ongoing disasters.

The spatial resilience chapter (Chapter 6) will comment ‘Why the PJ is Resilient?’ PJ
translates to a large fishing village; the fishing beach is not only an economic resource it
is also a cultural resource for the residents. The PJ residents fight to retain their cultural
and economic heritage. 75% of the households in the PJ are fishermen and depend on
the beach for their livelihood. The beach provides large open space where the fishermen
can repair their nets; store their boats, engines, and other equipment. More than that, the
beach is a public space where the fishermen relax and socialize after fishing. Just like
the beach, the streets of the PJ are active and lively. Transportation is a secondary use
of the streets; these streets are the living room of the community. On these streets the
kids play, women shop and socialize, and this is where festivals are colorful and loud.
The social, cultural, and economic benefits from the community motivate the residents to
fight for their community.

The social resilience chapter (Chapter 7) will address the question, ‘How is the PJ
Resilient?’ 90% of the residents in the PJ live below the international poverty line of
$1.25 a day. Despite their limited resources, in 2006, the residents donated $20,000 to
build a temple. The fishermen continue to give 1% of their income to sustain the temple.
The PJ residents also celebrate 10-12, religious festivals annually. These activities
strengthen the social networks within the community.

68

The story of PJ illustrates that even low-income slums can be resilient: temporally,
spatially and socially. Resilience on the ground is a long and laborious process; the PJ
residents collaborated with the government and non-government organizations to
improve the physical and social infrastructure of their slum. The residents invested time,
money and labor to rebuild their community from the ground up. Urban poor are not
vulnerable victims; they are fearsome warriors who can fight for their human rights, their
community rights, and their cultural rights. They can be resilient and survive against any
threat all they need is knowledge and support.

This chapter provided a brief background on the city of Visakhapatnam, operationalized
resilience and identified PJ as a resilient slum, which is an ideal case for this study.
Chapter 5 (Research approach and methods) outlines the proposed qualitative research

69

methods used in this research and limitations of the method. The next three chapters
present the three findings of this study. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of
resilience and how a coastal slum in India survived multiple disasters.

70

Chapter 4: Research Approach and Methods
Chapter 2 operationalized resilience and Chapter 3 identified the PJ in Visakhapatnam
as the research site. This chapter discusses the research methodology, data collection,
and data analysis methods used in this research. Given the nature of the overarching
research questions (Resilience to What; Why did the PJ residents fight for their
community and How was the PJ resilient), a qualitative ethnographic research is
proposed for this research. Between September 2013 and March 2014, preliminary data
about the PJ was collected. Preliminary data sources include GVMC household surveys
(GVMC, 2009); Department of Fisheries socio-economic survey on the fishermen in the
PJ (Immanuel & Rao, 2012); and Action Aid project reports outlining their programs and
successes in the PJ (Phillipose, 2013). After the preliminary data collection, an IRB
application was filed with University of Cincinnati’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). The
IRB approved the PJ research protocol in February 2014.

After the IRB approval, fieldwork in the PJ occurred from March thru July 2014. During
that time, 54 interviews (44 with the slum dwellers, 10 with government employees) and
three focus group discussions were held. Additionally, ethnographic observations were
recorded on a daily basis in a journal. These observations recorded the non-verbal
communication and overall vibe of the community. I spent an average of 15 hours per
week for five months to conduct interviews and 5 hours per week were spent on
participant observations.

There are three stages to the participant-observation study (Getting there, building
rapport and spending enough time to get the data) (Guest et.al, 2012). The first step of
this research was entering the community and observing the daily life in the public
spaces of the community such as the streets, temples and the beach. Second step of the
71

research process is building a rapport with the residents, through spending time in the
community and the help of the key informants; I built rapport with the slum dwellers.

The third stage of the participant-observation study is spending adequate time at the
community (Guest et.al, 2012). In addition to the time spent building rapport with the
residents, I attended a variety of activities in the community such as religious festivals,
co-operative board elections, feasts on the streets, and meetings with government
officials. The informal embedded nature of participant observation means that one
cannot always just delve straight into the research questions and then leave.

Originally, three types of activities were proposed in this research study. First, formal
interviews with government officials and NGO representatives with signed consent forms
(Appendix A). Second, informal interviews and observations with slum residents in their
homes, where the researcher presents her research study, provides the interviewees
with information sheet (Appendix A), and obtains a verbal consent. Informal interviews
are less structured compared to formal interviews and involve asking questions during
naturally occurring activities (Lofland & Lofland, 1984). Third, participant-observation in
common parts of Pedda Jalaripeta, where I was a known researcher and the slum
residents interacted with me as they saw fit. After entering the field, the fourth method of
data collection was added, focus groups. During interviews with the slum residents’
community members usually huddled together to narrate stories or discuss the
questions. These informal conversations among the residents were more organic and
casual; the residents felt more comfortable sharing their experiences and stories in this
setting. Based on these observations, three focus groups were organized to get the
community to discuss social capital and resilience of their community in a group setting.

72

The first key informant recruited into the research was Arun, who is a member of
community’s Grama Sabha and was the past-president of Marine Co-operative Society.
Arun introduced several fishermen to me and provided strong historical context to the
research. The two other informants in the study are Srikanth from the FYWA and Jaya
with the Women’s Cooperative under the FYWA. Srikanth and Jaya introduced me to the
younger fishermen and women in the community. These two cohorts added new
dimensions to the research and illustrated how the community has changed in just one
generation. These three informants were interviewed multiple times over the duration of
the study.

The original plan was to have one key source, but as the research progressed, it was
clear that a full immersion into the community would only be possible by having multiple
informants, one from each cohort. The three key informants represent the three primary
groups in the slum in the community (i.e., senior fishermen, young fishermen, and
women).

Formal Interviews with government officials and representatives of NGOs
Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with officials who work with the slum
residents on an ongoing basis. The questions focused on the evolution and history of the
PJ, the government funds and projects in the region over the past forty years. The aim
was to understand the interaction or lack thereof between the government agencies and
the slum residents. This first round of interviews averaged 45 minutes and aimed at
understanding the government’s perspective about the PJ. I interviewed the Joint
Director, Director, Field Development Officers with the Department of Fisheries. From
the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), the interviewees included
Capacity Building Training Coordinator, Urban Community Development Officer (UCDO),
73

Anganwadi Teacher, Assistant City Planner, City Planner, and the Zonal Engineer.
Some of these government employees like the UCD officer, Department of Fisheries
Director, and the Capacity Building Coordinator at the GVMC were interviewed multiple
time over the course of the research.

In addition to the government employees, leaders from three key institutions in the PJ
were interviewed: The President and Secretary of the Grama Sabha; Past President and
the current President of the two Marine Co-operative Societies (MCS); the President);
President, Treasurer, Secretary & Women’s wing president of the Fishermen Youth
Welfare Association (FYWA). These interviews averaged 45 minutes and were mostly in
Telugu language, many of these leaders were interviewed multiple times.

Informal interviews with slum residents in their homes
Interviews with the slum residents were informal and were in Telugu (local language).
These interviews were 20-45 minute long and were conversational. The aim of these
interviews was to understand the challenges of the residents and the role of the
community in their daily life.

Focus Groups
During informal meetings, the community members usually huddled together, discussing
research questions or narrating a story about their community. These informal
conversations among the residents were more organic and lively; the residents felt more
comfortable sharing their experiences and stories in this setting. After observing these
interactions during the interviews, three focus groups were organized with the older
fishermen, women and younger fishermen in the community.

74

Ethnographic observation in popular places in the PJ
The ethnographic observation component of this study included observing the spatial
layout of the community, use of public/private space, participation in religious festivals
(polaramma jatara), and social gatherings. I attended several community affairs such as
public information meeting organized by the Department of Fisheries; Marine cooperative society elections; women’s micro-savings group meeting, and the executive
board meetings of the Fishermen Youth Welfare Association (FYWA). Observations from
these encounters were entered in a digital journal; these entries were organized as three
themes: use of public/private space, social gatherings, the interaction between the
community members and government agencies.

Data Entry & Analysis
All the interviews were recorded using an electronic tape recorder, and the data was
later moved to a password-protected computer. NVIVO software was used to organize,
code and analyze the data. The researcher first surveyed the data (interviews and field
notes) to identify codes or themes. Some of the original themes included: disasters
within the community, multi-generation families, festivals, fishing, trust between the
residents & government, government regulations, institutions within the community (i.e.
Grama Sabha, FYWA, etc.). Over 15 such themes were identified; these were then
compared to find consistencies and differences.

The Nvivo program has the ability to create word clouds (figure 7) to illustrate the most
frequently used words in the interviews. The words, ‘group’, ’community’, ‘people’,
‘fishing’ ‘government’ ‘money’ are prominent in the word cloud. These words represent

75

the importance of fishing and community in the day-to-day lives of the slum residents.
Fishing is a socio-cultural and economic resource of the community.

In addition to the word cloud, the NVIVO software is designed to carry out administrative
tasks of organizing the data more efficiently. While the NVIVO software was helpful in
organizing and coding the data, it was of limited help in identifying the themes. The
central narrative of the research and the three findings of this research (temporal, spatial
and social) only became evident after multiple presentations and discussions with the
dissertation advisors.

76

Presentation of the data
As the data from the research was translated, transcribed and coded it became apparent
that the PJ community is a rich source of information about transformative resilience in
the context of slum redevelopments. Since the PJ redevelopment occurred nearly 30
years ago, the researcher witnessed how the PJ redevelopment created an atmosphere
for multi-generational resilience. The PJ residents invested time, energy and effort to
preserve and protect the unique social and cultural heritage of their community. This
research illustrates that the social and spatial characteristics of the PJ create a resilient
urban community that is desirable to multiple generations.

Throughout the dissertation, I use pseudonyms whenever quoting the slum residents
and the official title of the government employees when referring to their comments. The
only original name that I use in this dissertation is that of Mr. Olisetty Chinnaya, who was
the elected representative of the community during 1980-1990 period. Mr. Chinnaya was
instrumental in the PJ’s redevelopment, and he is well loved and respected in the
community. Since Mr. Chinnaya is now deceased, using his original name is a way to
honor his contribution to the PJ community.

Research Limitations
Key limitations of a qualitative ethnographic research such as the one conducted in this
dissertation are the limiting factors of language, the morphing effects of context,
imperfections of the researcher, and the ethical considerations surrounding the
verification and ownership of data. Despite these limitations, an ethnographic
methodology has the advantage of permitting the research process to acknowledge

77

inner structure and values inherent in a community and provides sensitivity to cultural
practices.

Language as a Boundary: Ethnography necessitates communication, whether oral or in
text form, narrative or in symbols. The researchers gather data and interpret it through
language. Language can be a limiting factor since the dialects and rhetoric embedded in
the local tongue might be different from the traditional understanding of the language.
This limitation was partially addressed in this dissertation since I was native of the city
(Visakhapatnam) and am familiar with the local dialect and rhetoric (Telugu). It was,
however, challenging to translate the flavor and nuances of Telugu into English.

Morphing effect of context: A second significant limitation of the ethnographic
methodology is that any temporal study paints the picture of the community at that
particular moment in history. The research site or the community is constantly evolving
in response to the natural or man-made environment. Therefore, any form of
generalization from the study is invalid. Ethnographies are temporal artifacts. As
ethnography is primarily a narrative, this imposes a temporal aspect on the text. Cultures
are not stationary, and a researcher cannot capture it in a moment of time analysis. Any
attempt at this is a simplification and exclusionary. Rather, culture is intrinsically
temporal, and all relationships are shifting over and through time in an organic way.

There is no one moment of absolute representation in an ethnographic research project;
any ethnography can be nothing more than a historical inscription of relationships over
time. Despite these temporal and context specific limitations, ethnographic techniques
can gather data about human behavior that cannot be obtained using quantitative
methodologies. In the case of this dissertation, months after completing the data
78

collection and after I returned to the US, the PJ was irreparably damaged by a category
four cyclone Hudhud. Although the slum has recovered since then, this research is much
more valuable since it paints the picture of the slum before the disaster.

The Researcher: Doing ethnography is a human task with human limitations. These
restrictions arise largely from interactions with individuals and the skills of the
researcher. Subjects may feel an obligation to provide behavior that is appropriate or
expected. The success of the research is dependent upon a special inter-personal
relationship with the researcher. The research participants in some cases want to
present a more positive image of the community. The only way to mitigate for this
limitation is through recruiting multiple key informants and interviewing residents from
diverse backgrounds. In the case of this dissertation, the researcher recruited three key
informants: an older fishermen (Arun) representing the two old institutions in the
community; the president (Srikanth) of a new NGO (FYWA) representing the younger
fishermen; and the president (Jaya) of women’s co-operative wing of FYWA representing
the women in the community. The three respondents, in turn, recruited residents in their
respective cohorts for the research project.

Verification of Data and Ownership of Data: A fourth limitation of the ethnographic
methodology is the verification of the data. The ethnographic narrative is recorded and
constructed by the researcher. It is telling a story by a participant observer in culture. A
participant observer or the researcher has no claim to any universal accuracy or truth as
understanding is always about one’s position in the general scheme. Since the
researcher is reporting based on second-hand information, this is a problematic notion
for the verification of data and truth in the data.

79

Therefore, conventional methods of verification are not relevant to an ethnographic
research because the data collected are of a fundamentally different nature, and it is
through this difference that the value and contribution of this research exists. Ball (1982,
p. 137) described two distinct kinds of knowledge, "acquaintance with" and "knowledge
of'’. The latter "knowledge of' is a formal, rational and systematic generation of
knowledge, where the researchers observations are checked and verified with exactness
and precision. This is in contrast to the former mentioned "acquaintance with"
knowledge, where the researcher creates data through personal and first-hand
encounters with the world. It is knowledge of doing and use, rather than formal and
systematic observation.

Ball (1982, p. 138) argues that the distinction between these two forms of knowledge is
important because the two forms have different functions, and they are not that same
knowledge with varying levels of accuracy and validity. They do not exist on a continuum
of reliable/objective/valid, and the criteria of one paradigm are not applicable to the other
paradigm.

Although the typical data verification techniques do not apply to the ethnographic
research methods, there are other techniques to verify and check the data generated
through that the investigation. Ball (1982, p. 139) suggests that in the realm of the
interpretive, verification is intrinsic to the process of research itself. That is, verification
cannot be separated from the collection and analysis of data, because the participant
observer is immediately sharing the context of the social setting, and simultaneously
constructing the account of the cultural setting. In this way, the participant observer is
entitled to participant validation or respondent validation. Ball (1982, p. 139) argues that
the observer's account of data is its own right, and has the validity of a source. It is in
80

this uniqueness of experience that the ethnographic text gains authority. The text is a
personal narrative in a discursive space (Pratt 1986, pp. 30-33).

Despite these limitations, qualitative ethnographic methodology offers three advantages
to this dissertation. First, it situates the researcher in the context of the slum, giving the
research sensitivity to the unique cultural understandings of that slum. In doing this, it
permits an ethical stance to the researcher as it acknowledges general structures and
value systems of both the researcher and the slum residents. Second, the ethnographic
methodology provides an in-depth understanding of social norms and rules within the
community. Thirdly, a strong advantage of the approach is the analysis of spatial growth
and use of public space in the slum.

Reflections of the Research Process
Research in the PJ started with naïve optimism that given my nativity and command over
the language, immersion into the community would be easier. As the actual research day
got closer realization dawned that there were significant socio-economic barriers
between the research participants and me. This section narrates my research journey
and lessons to future researchers using a similar research method.

The first step of this study was meeting the department of fisheries in the City of
Visakhapatnam to get an overall feel and vibe of the PJ community. The Department
provided an overview of their role in the PJ and advised me to contact Arun, the longtime leader of the Marine Cooperative Society (MCS) in the slum. Arun was
knowledgeable and informative. He provided a historical context for the study and
introduced me to several fishermen in the community.

81

Over a one-week period, I interviewed 15 fishermen and soon realized that Arun was
introducing me to only one cohort in the slum: older fishermen who criticized the state
government for lack of welfare schemes and loans. When Venkatesh, a senior fishermen
mentioned that their community has developed a lot in the past few years, Arun and the
other fishermen around immediately criticized the statement. These fishermen were
vehemently defending their argument that the government was not providing them any
benefits.

After a few more interviews, where the same narrative was repeated, I reached out to
other government agencies in a search for new informants. A colleague introduced me to
the Urban Community Development (UCD) Officer. The UCD department oversees
several welfare programs; it also organizes and runs the women micro savings groups in
the Pedda Jalaripeta and the surrounding slums. The UCD Officer commented that the
PJ has seen tremendous improvement and development in the past few years. She
introduced me to Jaya, who is president of the Women’s Cooperative under the FYWA.
Jaya soon became one of my key informants and introduced me to other women in the
community. While the fishermen were only interested in discussing the lack of
government benefits, the women were more concerned regarding the continually
increasing cost of fishing and the drastic reduction in catch. The women were worried
about how the men in the community do not have any other skills.

At this point in the study, I met and interviewed the president (Srikanth) and secretary
(Akhil) of FYWA, but I did not get an opportunity to talk to the other younger fishermen.
After several phone calls, Srikanth informed me about an upcoming meeting with their
members at 11:00 am the next day. The next day I called him at around 9:00 am to
check on the status of the meeting, only to learn that the meeting had already started. I
82

had to rush to the meeting and, fortunately, had an opportunity to interview some of the
residents and also conduct a focus group. This proved to Srikanth that I was a serious
researcher and after this endeavor, he was more responsive to my queries and was
always available to answer any questions either personally or over the phone.

Compared to the older fishermen, the younger fishermen, especially the FYWA leaders
were politically savvy and were very aware of their bureaucratic and legal procedures.
These leaders worked closely with government departments and guided the fishermen
with regards to issues such as registering their fishing boats, applying for fishing
licenses, applying for housing loans and other bureaucratic procedures. FYWA also
conducts several educational workshops to train the fishermen in new techniques. The
NGO is currently petitioning the government agencies for a co-operative cold storage
where the fishermen can store their catch.

Contrary to my initial assumption that one key informant might be enough to guide the
research, the experience on the ground showed that multiple key informants are
necessary to get a multi-pronged analysis of the community. Key informants play a
crucial role they not only provide information but also give credibility to the research.

In addition to the issue of multiple sources, there were several challenges with
ethnographic research methods: consent forms, male research assistant and the apathy
of the government employees. Before starting the research, I assumed that the slum
dwellers would not sign consent forms. During the research, I found that the residents
were eager to a sign a paper since it meant their voice is heard. Perlman (1976) writes
about a similar experience in her research, where the members of the community who
were not randomly selected asked her why they were not being interviewed. Perlman
83

reports that she had to create dummy surveys just to satisfy those members who were
not randomly selected.

The second issue was the role of gendered bodies on the research site. Datta (2012)
comments that having a male research assistant improved her standing with the male
research participants during her research in Delhi Slums. Similarly, during my research
trips to the PJ, a family member, as well as a key informant, always accompanied me.
Having someone from the community and one from the family gave me more credibility
as a researcher.

Several authors have previously commented on the government employees apathy or
unwillingness to help researchers (Datta, 2012; Roy, 2003). I spent several weeks
visiting Department of Fisheries and GVMC to get information about the PJ. After several
unsuccessful attempts, I contacted an old colleague who works in the Ministry of Urban
Poverty Alleviation. Only after making this essential contact, did I get information and
interviews with the GVMC officials. Inadequate contacts in the Department of Fisheries
proved tiresome, and that department only provided limited information (Fishermen
census) verbally after repeated visits.

The socio-economic differences between research participants and the researchers
often come up during interviews. More than once, I was asked if I could take a research
participant with me to the United States as domestic help. Other female ethnographers
who studied low-income neighborhoods also report similar conversations with their
research participants (Casanova, 2011; Roy, 2009). These awkward interactions confirm
that the socio-economic differences between the researchers and researched will always
exist in qualitative research.
84

This chapter outlined the research methodology including limitation and challenges on
the field. Chapters 5 thru 7 present the findings, Chapter 5: Temporal Resilience,
responds to the first research question, ‘Resilience to What?’ Chapter 6: Spatial
Resilience, addresses ‘Why the PJ residents fight for their community?’, Chapter 7:
Social Resilience responds to the question, ‘How can PJ residents with minimal
resources survive multiple challenges?’

85

Chapter 5: Temporal Resilience: Disasters, what and when?
After a fire destroyed PJ in 1983, it rose from its ashes like a phoenix, emerging into a
lively, vibrant urban neighborhood. The 1980s redevelopment transformed the physical
infrastructure of the PJ while retaining the social networks and ecological resources of
the community. In early 2000, tourist-oriented developments threatened to gentrify PJ
and threatened the community’s livelihood (fishing). The slum residents used legal
measures to impede those threats and retain their quality of life. The story of the PJ is
one of resilience and perseverance; it is a story about how the urban poor survive and
manage to thrive in the midst of ongoing disasters.

Resilience, as conceptualized in this study comprises three dimensions: coping, adaptive
and transformative capacity. Coping and adaptive capacity refer to the ability of a
community to survive or prepare for an upcoming disaster. Transformative capacity, on
the other hand, refers to physically or socially improving the community so that it can
avoid the adverse effects of a disaster.

Contemporary literature on slums establishes that slum dwellers possess high amounts
of coping and adaptive capacities and are adept at using resources on hand to survive
disasters (Ajibade, McBean, & Bezner-Kerr, 2013; Braun & Aßheuer, 2011; Chatterjee,
2010; Keck & Etzold, 2013). The transformative capacity of slum dwellers, however, is
not sufficiently researched (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 operationalized transformative
resilience of slum dwellers based on four criteria: physical capital, human capital, social
capital and ecological capital; the PJ in the City of Visakhapatnam has adequate
reserves of these four capitals and is selected as an ideal case study to illustrate the
transformative resilience of the slum dwellers.

86

This dissertation aims to analyze the transformative capacity of slum dwellers through
three research questions: Resilience to What (Temporal)? Why Resilience (Spatial)?
Resilience How (Social)? These three perspectives/lenses (Temporal, Spatial, and
Social) illustrate the transformative resilience of the PJ. These multiple perspectives help
unravel the complex physical and social layers that allow a community to fight against
natural and man-made threats. This chapter (temporal perspective) narrates the
historical evolution of the PJ, the disasters it has faced over the past forty years and how
the community overcame those challenges. The findings from this research will
challenge the view of slum dwellers as passive victims and illustrate their
resourcefulness not merely to survive but thrive in the midst of impossible challenges.

1983 Fire and Civilization
In 1969, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) officially notified the
Pedda Jalaripeta slum. Official notification refers to a tenure formalization policy, where
the state officially recognizes a settlement as a slum and protects the occupancy rights
of the residents (Nakamura, 2014). Notified slums are eligible for infrastructure and
services provided by local municipalities. Tenure formalization is expected to facilitate
the investment of slum households in their houses by working on their motivation and
capacity.

At the time of the official notification, the PJ had 800 huts and all the residents were
fishermen. During that era, officials from the newly constructed Visakhapatnam Port
Authority approached the fishermen with employment offers at the new port as
permanent employees, but the fishermen refused the job offers. The residents were

87

poor, and fishing was hard work, but they were content with their lifestyle (Personal
interview with Omkar 3/22/2014).

On December 17, 1983, an election banner in the idyllic fishing village (PJ)
caught fire, and the fire ravaged 600 of the 800 huts in the slum. Following are
some excerpts from the senior citizens recollecting the accident. When our
houses burned down, we ran towards the sea. Since it was winter, we were
holding on to blankets, and we were shivering- (Pramila focus group interview
5/22/2014.)
My wife was pregnant at that time, so my mother took her away from the crowd. I
was helping the rest of the residents and could not accompany them. After the
rescue work, I started looking for them, but it was so chaotic I could not find
them. I finally found them away from the crowd sitting in the dark; I was very
relieved to find them. My wife gave birth to our son three days after the fire.
(Personal interview with Prasad, the President of PJ’s Grama Sabha,
04/03/2014.)
After the fire we had nowhere to live, some of us lived with our friends and
relatives while other built new temporary shacks closer to the beach (Personal
interview with Arun 03/22/2014.)
The 1983 fire burned down 600 of the 800 huts in the community. The residents lost their
houses, their possessions and fled to the open beach on a cold December night. The
slum dwellers had nowhere to go after the fire and took shelter with their friends or
relatives. The entire scene was chaotic, and there was no emergency personnel to
assist the slum dwellers to cope with the disaster. Instead, the community members took
charge and helped each other out.

In 1979, a few years before the fire, the GVMC (Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal
Corporation) launched the Visakhapatnam Slum Improvement Program (VSIP), to
provide comprehensive development for slum communities by converging resources
from different departments (Amis & Kumar, 2000). After the fire incident, the GVMC
officials proposed redeveloping the PJ under the Urban Community Development
program with infrastructure and serviced lots. The GVMC officials wanted the slum
88

dwellers to leave their houses to start the redevelopment process. The residents did not
trust the government officials, rejected the redevelopment proposal and refused to
abandon their homes.

Mr. Olisetty Chinnaya, who was the elected representative of the community during that
time (Member of Legislative Assembly, MLA), convinced the residents that he would
oversee the redevelopment efforts. Since Mr. Chinnaya was a Jalari5, who was born and
raised in the PJ, the residents trusted him and vacated their houses (Personal interviews
with Prasad 4/3/2014; Omkar 3/22/2014; and Arun 3/22/2014).

Chinnaya appointed community's Grama Sabha as the Neighborhood Committee in
charge of the redevelopment. Grama Sabha not only monitored the redevelopment but
also allotted the redeveloped lots to the rightful owners. The PJ redevelopment program
is a Type-2 slum redevelopment program, where the government lays out the
infrastructure (water, sewer, and roads) but does not construct the actual houses. The
underlying idea of self-help housing is that urban poor are capable of both accumulating
and using a variety of assets to improve their living environments. The assumption here
is that slum residents will strategically upgrade their housing and living facilities while
weighing their changing priorities throughout the course of their lives (Nakamura, 2014).

Starting in mid-1960s countries across the world like Chile, Pakistan, Iraq, Colombia,
and Turkey implemented Type 2- slum redevelopment programs. But many of these
programs failed, either due to poor quality construction, failure of infrastructure or
gentrification of the slum (Peattie, 1982). However in the case of the PJ, thirty years after

5

75% of the residents in the PJ belong to the Jalari caste (GVMC, 2009), Jalari literally means fishermen
and the social status of Jalari’s in the Hindu caste system is very low.

89

the redevelopment the slum continues to provide quality affordable housing and is
probably one of the very few success stories of Type 2- slum redevelopment program.

PJ’s redevelopment had several advantages, spatial, social, ecological, economic,
physical and human. Since residents received individual lots, they had the opportunity to
expand vertically in the future (spatial). The redevelopment did not displace any of the
residents thereby retaining social networks of trust within the community (social). Houses
followed a gridiron pattern, and direct public access to the beach was assured
(ecological and economic resource). The physical infrastructure laid out as part of the
redevelopment improved the drainage, sanitation and water supply in the community
thereby drastically reducing the spread of water-borne diseases and improving the
overall health of the residents (Abelson, 1996).

In 1984, the government gave us a 60 gajas of land (540 sq. feet). They gave us
some rods, cement, gave us Rs. 30,000 ($500) worth of building material. So we
added another Rs. 60,000 and built these houses for a total of Rs. 90,000. But
not all of us got the scheme; I had to save and borrow to build my house.
(Personal interview with Omkar (03/15/2014.)
GVMC allotted tracts of land, building material and limited funding to those who lost their
houses in the fire. There were two phases of the redevelopment. The government
assigned 432 lots in the first phase (1984-85) and 50 lots in the second phase (1990-91)
were assigned. Since the residents were responsible for design and construction, the
houses were personalized per individual taste, and the construction is still intact after
multiple generations.

Slum redevelopments are often notorious for disrupting the social-ecological integrity and
leaving the urban poor worse off after the redevelopment (Andavarapu & Edelman,
2013; S. Patel, 2013; J. Perlman, 2004). The PJ redevelopment was successful primarily
90

due to the involvement of the Mr. Olisetty Chinnaya, who was the MLA at the time of the
redevelopment. Mr. Chinnaya used his influence and convinced the GVMC to assign the
Grama Sabha as the slum’s neighborhood committee in charge of the redevelopment.
The Grama Sabha leaders are well respected in the PJ, and their involvement gave
credibility to the redevelopment process.

As the official neighborhood committee, the Grama Sabha collaborated with the GVMC
on issues ranging from the site planning to the allocation of lots. This direct link between
the community and government allowed for a successful redevelopment. In the case of
the PJ, the redevelopment enhanced the physical capital and human capital of the
community without disrupting the residents’ social capital and ecological capital. When a
community reinvents and redevelops itself after a disaster, its persistence to survive and
thrive illustrates its transformative resilience (Keck & Sakdapolrak, 2013).

Thirty years after the redevelopment, the slum dwellers continue to recall Mr. Chinnaya
with affection and respect. Typically, there is very little trust between the bureaucrats and
the slum residents, without Mr. Chinnaya’s involvement the slum redevelopment would
have been more chaotic and could have resulted in some displacement. Although the
formal redevelopment ended a few years ago, the PJ continues to expand. Today, some
of the original houses have expanded vertically and are nearly three stories tall (figure
8). In addition to the formal development, more houses continue to be built informally.
The informal growth was only possible since the physical infrastructure was laid out as
part of the 1984 redevelopment. Through government programs, amenities in the
community such as schools, Anganwadi’s (government funded preschool crèches), and
Sulabh Complex (pay to use public toilets) have improved and increased consistently
over the years.

The human capital6 in the slum, in areas such as health, education, birth control, and
quality-of-life, has improved significantly after the 1980s slum redevelopment. The PJ
became more desirable and livable to the younger generations due to these physical
changes and quality-of-life improvements. The residents, especially the older citizens,
ruminate about how the community has changed in just one generation:

Our ancestors used to go fishing on a wooden boat and they were wearing just a
loincloth. Today, the fishermen are wearing pants while fishing, so we don’t know
if it’s a fisherman or a student. Civilization has increased and has come into our
village. - Omkar 3/22/2014.
Yes, we developed a lot after our houses were burned. When we used to live in
the thatched roof huts, we did not know anything. We were saving money, but we
did not know about houses, clothes or jewelry. Back then we used to have four or
five kids, now these youngsters just have one or two kids and then get an
operation (family planning)—Priya 4/1/2014.
6 Improved sanitation, drainage and water supply in the PJ reduced the spread of water borne diseases such as

diarrhea, cholera etc… and improved the health of the residents especially the children (Abelson, 1996).

92

Civilization is increasing right so unity is increasing. Once we were not civilized,
but now the younger generation is very civilized they come back from fishing
wear pant and shirt and then go for a movie, drink juice. - Virat 3/22/2014.
…Civilization has increased, people’s style has increased. People are also
buying new stuff, new clothes, and new things for houses. Now people have
more money, everybody is working back then we used to have 4 or 5 kids. Now
days it is only one or two kids and then operations (family planning). So now they
have a better life. They are also educating their kids. These days some people
are limiting to only one kid- Sobha 4/1/2014
The above excerpts illustrate the fact that the PJ residents see a significant difference in
their lives before and after the slum redevelopment. The exact word used during the
interviews was ‘nagarikata’ which translates directly to civilization. The word usage could
indicate that the residents catapulted from a rural to an urban lifestyle in just one
generation. This change was not gradual, and the older generation often marvels at how
fast the younger residents have adapted to the urban way of life. Urban ideologies such
as education, birth control, and even the use of household appliances (TV, Fridge, Gas
stove, etc.) were not part of the PJ’s life style before the redevelopment. The differences
among the older and younger generations of the PJ residents are also visible to the
government employees such as the Urban Community Development Officer and
Anganwadi teacher serving in the community:

…Five years ago many were not civilized they would get drunk and get into
trouble and such but now they are more educated. The slum residents are well
versed in welfare schemes, they know their rights. - Personal interview with UCD
officer 5/18/2014.
In the past when we used to ask kids to study, the parents were very reluctant.
We started a scheme in 1995 that was funded by an American agency; A lot of
kids in the area received a scholarship to attend school under that scheme. A lot
of kids from our Anganwadi attended school using that scheme. Since then there
has been a lot of interest in education and jobs in Pedda Jalaripeta. Several kids
from this area are working in jobs even girls. - Personal interview with Anganwadi
teacher 5/22/2014

93

The UCD officer and Anganwadi teacher have worked in the PJ for several decades and
have seen the community develop from a small fishing village to a low-income urban
neighborhood. As seen in these excerpts from the residents and the government
officials, the PJ’s physical changes brought several social and cultural changes in the
community.

Encroachments on the Coastal Regulation Zone
When a slum redevelopment improves the physical and human capital of the slum
residents without disturbing their social and ecological capital, the redevelopment
transforms the community into a stable, resilient state. In the case of the PJ, this resilient
state lasted for nearly 20 years. The PJ faced a second threat in early 2000 when
tourism oriented developments started encroaching on the community threatening to
gentrify the PJ and challenged the residents right to the beach and fishing.

At the beginning of 2000, the state government launched several programs to convert
the Visakhapatnam’s seacoast into a tourist destination. As part of the process,
Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) acquired tracks of land in the City
of Visakhapatnam and created Special Economic Zones to build tourism infrastructure.
The state government’s focus on tourism prompted the private sector to invest in touristoriented projects such as five-star hotels, amusement parks, and restaurants all along
the Visakhapatnam coastline. These developments were threatening the coastal ecosystem as well as the cultural integrity of the PJ community. The older leaders in the PJ
are not equipped to deal with changes to their seacoast and quality-of-life.

When VUDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Vizag Beach Resorts
Ltd., a private company, the threat of gentrification was further solidified. The MOU
94

supports development on the Visakhapatnam beach for tourist destinations such as
beach resorts, discotheques (pubs), star hotels, cinemas, nature care parks, etc. worth
up to 20 Billion Rupees7. The tourism plan, if implemented, would displace 45,000 fisher
folk families, including the families in the PJ. The first phase of the MoU project was
widening the road from Visakhapatnam to Bheemunipatnam (Equations, 2008; Philipose,
2013).
In 2003, the Fishermen Youth Welfare Association (FYWA)8 along with the District
Fishermen Youth Welfare Association filed a writ petition (WP No: 25078/2003) against
the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) in the Andhra Pradesh High
Court arguing that the road widening violated the Coastal Regulation Zone notification.
The court case halted the project for three years. VUDA was forced to make some
modifications to its original plan (Philipose, 2013). Eventually, the MoU with the Vizag
Beach Resorts Ltd. was canceled (Equations, 2008).

It was a CRZ violation. Firstly, the road would fall under CRZ 1, where
construction is not allowed. Second a lot of fishermen used that area for drying
fish and it is a source of income for us. Third there is no need for a four-lane road
way from Bhimli to here (Visakhapatnam), there is not enough traffic to warrant
the demolition of a hill. (Raghav, 5/10/14)
Raghav is the treasurer of FYWA and, as seen in the excerpt, the fishermen had a
strong case to oppose the road widening. Additionally, the purpose of widening the
Visakhapatnam to Bhimunipatnam road was to make the PJ region attractive for
investors in the tourism sector. The FYWA filed the court case to demonstrate that

7 $321.44 million at a conversion rate of 62.22 rupees per dollar

under the guidance of Action Aid, an international NGO.

95

tourism development was not welcome in their community and that they are willing to
fight to preserve their community.

The government and other private developers were shocked that ‘ordinary fisher folk’,
could stall the project by at least for a few years (Interview with Srikanth 04/20/2014).
Between 2000 and 2014, the FYWA filed 13 court cases against the government and
private agencies for violating the CRZ guidelines (Appendix A). Over these years, FYWA
has perfected a step-by-step approach to fighting or protesting developments that
encroach on the coastal protection zone or are close to the PJ.

Sometimes these groups don’t take all the required permissions. They just pay
money and manage at the local level without getting the required clearances. So
we gather all the required information and find out whether the company has
applied for all the permissions and then take this info to the court (FYWA focus
group, 5/11/14).
When a private developer or a government agency proposes a new development near
the PJ, the FYWA members gather information about the project. They request
information about the project from the concerned departments through the Right to
Information legislation. The FYWA members enquire with all the relevant government
agencies to verify if the developers have complied with all the local, state and federal
regulations. If the developer has skipped any steps or if the project violates any laws, the
FYWA members file a written petition with the concerned department outlining their
findings and how the proposed development does not meet the letter of the law. They
organize a press release to discuss and advocate their case on how the proposed
project violates the rules of the law. Based on the proposed development and the
request from the FYWA, the city departments have occasionally denied the development
projects. If the departments approve the proposed development, FYWA takes the
96

documentation that they have built on the project and files a legal petition in the court
against the proposed development.

Over these years, FYWA has become a well-recognized and respected organization
within the community. In addition to these court filings, the FYWA maintains an active
presence in the community by conducting a wide variety of workshops on topics as
diverse as ‘new fishing techniques,' ‘storing and marketing catch to increase revenue,'
‘domestic worker rights,' ‘self-defense for women and girls’. FYWA also works as a
liaison between government agencies and the slum dwellers. The association assists the
residents with registering their boats, applying for fishing licenses and other such
activities (FYWA focus group, 5/11/14; women focus group 5/20/14; and interview with
Raghav, 5/10/14).

The FYWA is the brainchild of Srikanth, who was born and brought up in the PJ. In the
1990s Srikanth was a youth volunteer at Action Aid. During that time, he received a
fellowship to attend and participate in workshops organized by the NGO. These
workshops educated Srikanth and other youth in the fishing villages in and around the
city of Visakhapatnam about federal and state regulations such as the Marine Fisheries
Regulation Act9, Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)10, and the Right to Information Act11.
These workshops also provided training regarding the judicial process for filing legal

CRZ was to regulate development along the coastal

petitions against projects that threaten to gentrify the PJ or infringe on the rights of the
fishermen and fishing communities.

Unlike the 1983 fire that ravished the entire community within a few minutes, touristoriented development is a slow moving threat. Just like the fire ushered a new era of
development, the tourist-oriented development ushered in a new era of political thinking
in the community. The older leaders of the PJ primarily focus on welfare programs such
as low-interest loans and subsidies for boats or houses. These older leaders are illiterate
and therefore depend on the elected representative or government officials to assist
them with welfare schemes (Senior citizen focus group 5/22/2014). On the contrary, the
youth leadership at the FYWA is educated and empowered. FYWA is a rights based
organization, and these youth leaders are not afraid to challenge the elected
representatives or the government officials. FYWA leaders use the media or take legal
action to fight for their human rights, their community rights and their rights as fishermen.

Temporal Lens- “Disasters, What and When?"
Over a four-decade period, the PJ changed dramatically. The 1980s slum
redevelopment provided permanent, durable housing and infrastructure to the residents.
Based on the focus groups and interviews, the physical improvements in the community
improved education, birth control, income and other facets of daily life. The
redevelopment urbanized and modernized the community.

Thirty years after the redevelopment, PJ continues to provide an affordable quality of life
to the residents and encourages the younger generation to live in the community. When
tourist-oriented development, threatened to gentrify PJ and challenged the community's
livelihood, the younger fishermen collaborated with an external agency to preserve their
98

community’s quality of life. As seen in this chapter, resilience in the PJ is manifested
through the residents’ persistence to save the social and cultural heritage of their
community and their ability to collaborate with external agencies. Resilience on the
ground is a long and laborious process. The PJ residents invested time, money and
labor to preserve the unique social and cultural heritage of their community. The spatial
and social characteristics of the slum create a unique, livable community that is worth
fighting. PJ provides quality affordable housing that supports multi-generational families;
the community has access to an ecological resource that provides a healthy source of
income. The community also has high reserves of social capital. The next two chapters
(6 and 7) will discuss the spatial and social characteristics of the PJ to elaborate on their
role in the ongoing resilience of the PJ.

Chapter 6: Spatial Resilience: Growth & Public Space
Tucked along the city of Visakhapatnam’s glittery beach coast is the PJ. Despite its
location in prime real estate, the PJ retains its character as a quaint little fishing village.
This laid back street life is one of the spatial characteristics that define the slum; the
residents and the government officials often refer to the community as ‘uuru’ (village).
The PJ enjoys the village like atmosphere along with urban amenities such as
anganwadis, schools and hospitals at an affordable housing cost. The streets perform
multiple functions: the younger kids play on the street; the older women sit on the porch
steps watching life go by; the women carry water to their home from the hand pump; or
go to the market to sell the catch of the day; and then there is occasional marriage
procession that lights up the streets (figure 10).

Popular media often portray slums as dirty and filthy where the streets are filled with raw
sewage and the houses are nothing more than shacks. Compared to that image the PJ
looks like a middle-income neighborhood. Despite its outward appearance, the slum still
struggles with poverty12 and poor infrastructure13 and is therefore officially notified as a
slum by the GVMC.

Chapter 5 illustrated how the PJ residents survived a fire and continues to fight
gentrification threats. The slum retained its unique social and cultural heritage over the
past 40 years. This chapter illustrates the two spatial characteristics that play a critical

12

The international poverty rate is $1.25 per day per person (UN-Habitat, 2010). In 2009, 96.8% of the PJ
residents earned Rs. 6000 per month for a family of four representing a $0.80 per person per day(at a
conversion rate of $1=Rs.62.22) (GVMC, 2009).

13 Over 50% of the residents in the PJ do not have toilets and use the public toilets paying Rs. 2 per visit.

Water is supplied only for 2 hours a day.

role in the PJ’s ongoing resilience: the slum’s potential to grow and accommodate multigenerational families; and its public-private spaces, namely the streets and the fishing
beach. The formal and informal growth in the PJ is illustrated through four case studies.
The next section discusses the role of active and vibrant public spaces (streets and
fishing beach) in the long- term transformative resilience of the PJ.

Growth
The 1980s formal redevelopment extended infrastructure (water, sewer and roads) into
the slum and induced informal growth. The original redevelopment followed a clear grid
pattern, which is visible in all the aerial images seen in figure 11. These formal plots of
land allotted to the individual households expanded vertically as families grew (through
construction of second and third floors). Similarly, new houses were constructed over the
years, which extended the PJ horizontally. This potential to grow or expand the
community is the one of the reasons that the PJ retained its identity. This spatial growth
retained the next generation of fishermen in the community. The younger fishermen are
educated and formed new connections or linkages with external agencies to protect and
preserve their community and their lifestyle into the future.

Images in figure 11 illustrate the stark contrast between the clear grid pattern of the
1980s redevelopment and the organic growth of the community that has occurred west
of the formal development. This informal growth follows the existing contours of the land.
As the growth continues to expand towards the sea, some of the newer houses,
especially those seen in the 2005 and 2014 aerial images, fall in the coastal regulation
zone and are too close to the sea. The fishermen are aware of the danger of living so
close to the sea, but they chose to take the risk and continue residing in the same
community rather than moving to another community.

Four case studies are presented here to illustrate the formal and informal growth in the
PJ. As will be seen in the case studies, most of the houses both old and new have a tiny
footprint (often less than 600 sq. ft.) creating a dense urban fabric.

Formal Growth
Arun and his wife Priya: Arun is a 60-year-old fisherman, he has three daughters and a
son, and all his kids grew up in his 540 sq. ft. house. He is no longer fishing but
continues to be active socially. He is one of the informants of this research and is the
past president of the Marine Cooperative Society and is also the member of the Grama
Sabha. The 1987 fire destroyed Arun’s old family hut, and he was allotted a new plot
during the first phase of the slum redevelopment. His house is minimal only a single
story building, with kitchen in the front verandah and two rooms behind the verandah
(figure 12).

Figure 12: Arun's House Plan

Source: Author

As seen in figure 12, the largest room in Arun’s house has a queen size bed, attic space
and a small television in the corner. Between the wall and the bed, rests a small sofa.
There is a narrow walking space between the furniture to move into the next room. The
last room has a storage shelf (figure 12). Unlike other Indian houses, the kitchen in many
of the houses in the PJ is at the entrance, so that the smell of the cooking (mainly fresh
104

seafood) does not enter the house. The toilet is outside the main quarters under the
stairs. All the houses in the area have toilets outside, designed that way primarily for
ventilation. The toilets are pour flush and do not have piped water connections.

their house; Priya at their toilet; Arun, Priya and a neighbor in their house; Arun's kitchen

In figure 13, Arun’s wife Priya is standing in the doorway, while his 90-year-old mother is
sitting on the porch steps. The wood stocked up along their house is the only income
source for the family. The second picture on the right hand shows Priya standing next to
the toilet; the WC is on her right while the bathroom is behind her. The third picture
105

shows Arun along with a neighbor; the fourth picture shows Arun’s kitchen, which is at
the entrance of the house. As seen in the pictures the house is a little cramped but is
clean and provides the basic comforts such as cooking, eating, sleeping and sanitation.

Rani’s House: Rani’s family (her husband and two kids) lives in a two-story house, with
her in-laws (parents of her husband and her brother-in-law’s family). Rani’s family is one
of the few non-fishermen families residing in the area. Rani’s father-in-law was allotted
the house during the redevelopment. Rani's father-in-law added the second floor after
his sons got married. The parents live on the second floor, and the two brothers and their
families share the ground floor. Rani’s house has a similar footprint as Arun’s house.
However, unlike Arun’s house, the kitchen in this house is located inside the house
rather than at the front of the building. The rooms are only large enough to
accommodate a queen size bed.

Multi-generational families are a cultural norm in India. Indian family is, by and large,
patriarchal in structure. The patriarch of the Indian family is a conservative authoritarian
figure worthy of respect by family members. In a patriarchal family setup, all male
members, i.e., husband, elder brother and father perform duties like decision making for
the rest of the household and their physical and moral protection. In return, all the family
members not necessarily inferiors had to obey the family seniors and elders.

As seen in figure 14, Rani and her mother in law were sitting in front of their house
chatting with neighbors in the afternoon during the interview. The slum residents
especially women step out of the house to socialize and talk. The streets provide relief
from the cramped indoor space that can be humid and hot during the summer months.

Informal Growth
Since 2009, the PJ has witnessed informal growth primarily moving closer and closer
towards the sea as seen in the Google aerial images (figure 11). This growth is informal
since there is no master plan to expand the community, and it is piecemeal one house at
a time. Some of these houses are little more than a roof over the head, but some of
them are well constructed with elaborate details. While the larger elaborate houses show
the desirability of the community since the residents that can afford a large home,
choose to stay in the community (Sobha’s Home). The smaller houses attest the
affordability of the community (Sita’s Home).

107

Sobha’s Home: Sobha is a fisherwoman her husband and sons are fishermen. Sobha
along with her family built four houses, three houses for her sons, one for her husband
and her.

Figure 15: Sobha's House Plan

Source: Author

As seen in figure 15 (key map), each house has its entrance, kitchen, toilets and stairs to
access the roof. The house plan is similar to Arun’s house where the kitchen is at the
entrance, and toilets are outside the house to allow for ventilation. The multi-purpose
room has a television, small refrigerator, and a queen size bed.

As seen in figure 16, the kitchen of the house is tiny but has a beautiful back splash, and
storage shelf. The house has brick walls and a concrete slab, it has false ceilings and
the walls have elaborate artwork. Since Sobha’s house is in the Coastal Regulation
Zone, she did not receive any financial assistance or bank loans to build the house. The
house was built entirely with her family’s earnings and savings. However, the house and
its amenities would not have been possible without the infrastructure (water, sewer, and
electricity) that was laid out as part of the formal development. Sobha’s family is the new
108

version of the multi-generational family. Where all the sons have their homes, but are still
connected to their parents and the family as a whole is a single unit.

Sita’s House: Some of the informal houses in the PJ are very minimalistic. Sita’s house
is one of the units in a block. All the houses on this block have the same house plan and
deal with the same issues.

As seen in figure 17, Sita’s house is a tin shack with an open drain in the back. It’s a
small 12’ X 10’ room with a 2 ft. wide-open space in the rear. This open area is used for
bathing, washing clothes and dishes. Sita’s house has municipal water (2 hours a day)
and electric connection but does not have sewer connection. Figure 18 shows the single

109

multi-purpose room Sita’s family lives in (Sita her husband and their adult kids). As seen
in the images above, the construction quality is poor, and space is tight.

When it rains, the open drain at the back of the house gets blocked with all the dirt; the
sewer water then enters their house. Sita’s family prepares for a storm by storing all their
possessions as high up as they can and waits till the water drains to clean their homes.
This family uses the public toilets for defecation and pays Rs. 2 ($0.03) for each use.
985 houses of the 1833 houses in the PJ do not have access to sewer and the residents
defecate outdoors (along the beach) or use the public toilets. Many of the houses in the
PJ look similar to this house.

Public Space
The public spaces in the PJ play a prominent role in the transformative resilience of the
slum. The two most vibrant public spaces are its streets and the fishing beach. Both of
these spaces are crucial to the social fabric of the community as they provide an
opportunity for the residents to interact with each other on a regular basis.

Interview with Praveen on 3/11/2014
As can be seen in the conversation with a 70-year-old retired fisherman, the fishermen
prefer to spend time at the public beach with their peers. In contrast to the cramped
living quarters, the streets and beach are open and pleasant with cold sea breeze. The
residents of the slum, therefore, tend to spend more time outdoors. In the next two
sections, the streets and the beach of the PJ will be explored for their role in the
transformative resilience of the slum.

The Streets of the PJ
The active and vibrant streets in the PJ serve multiple purposes. First, they are used as
transportation networks. Streets are an extension of the house to store water, to prepare
meals and to play. The streets are a social space where women gather around to chat in
the afternoon. Streets are the epicenter of social activity in the PJ where the slum
residents gather for religious and social functions (figure 19 and 20).

The first two images in figure 19 show the preparations for ‘feasts on streets’; the last
two pictures in figure 19, show the women who monitor the cooking process. The PJ is a
very close-knit community where the large life events in the family such as marriage and
death are celebrated or mourned with a feast for 500-600 closest relatives. None of the
houses in the community have the space to cook for that many guests. On those
occasions, the streets become the living/dining room for that evening and night. Traffic is
diverted to use other streets and the residents cook right on the streets. Before the feast,
112

streets are thoroughly cleaned, and decorated with lights and mats are placed on the
ground, for the guests to sit.

preparation; the women monitoring the cooking and socializing.

The feasts themselves are very festive and loud, with music blaring out of the speakers.
People sit in batches of 50 or 60 at a time in long lines, while the hosts and their family
members go around with serving bowls and serve food to those who are sitting. The food
is served in banana leafs, which are considered auspicious. The feast usually consists of
several courses. The first course is desserts and papad, followed by rice, two curries,
lentil soup and ends with rasam (a tangy soup) and buttermilk. The men usually have
113

liquor before or after the feast but not during it. During the feast itself juice or water is
served. Ice-cream cups are also a favorite dessert at these festivals. The music
continues to blare throughout the night. These festivals often start late at night and go till
midnight or later. There is a lot of teasing, talking and laughing at these festivals. The
sounds, food, and festive spirit are contagious.

Even on regular days when there are no festivals, the streets of the PJ are always
active. The street is often an extension of the home where the kids play and the women
shop, socialize or even prepare their dinners (figure 20). Mundane household chores like
meal preparation become a social event in the PJ. The images in figure 20 show that
114

streets in the PJ serve multiple purposes. Transportation is an ancillary activity of these
streets. The primary role of these streets is to act as the living room for the PJ residents.

Access to Beach
There are three top tourist attractions in the city of Visakhapatnam. A 55-acre historical
VUDA park with dancing fountains, skating ring and other activities (figure 21). Tenneti
Park and Kailashgiri a 380-acre hill top park with amenities such as rope way or
cableway, giant statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi. The leisurely RK beach,
which is a public beach for swimming, picnics and volleyball. Visakhapatnam's beach
road is also famous for uninterrupted panoramic views of the beach. Nestled among
these tourist destinations is the PJ.

Figure 21: PJ and surrounding Tourist Destinations

Source: Google Earth
The top three tourist destinations in Visakhapatnam (figure 21) are a stone’s throw away
from the PJ, which is why, the government, as well as private agencies, are proposing
developments in proximity to the PJ. Unlike the tourist beachfront, the PJ’s beach is a

115

fishing beach. Pedda Jalaripeta translates as large fishing village, and 75% of the
households in this slum are dependent on fishing. The beach is not only an economic
resource it is also a cultural resource for the community. After spending their day at sea
casting craft into the rough waters of the subcontinent's coastal belt, the fishermen return
to the shore with the catch and the fisherwomen take over. The fisherwomen collect the
catch, take it to the fishing harbor a few miles out of the community and auction the
catch to fish vendors. The fishermen’s boats, boat engines, and other fishing-related
items crowd the PJ beach.

Figure 22: PJ Beach: Fishermen repairing net and relaxing in the sheds.

Even though the PJ residents have branched out into other occupations- carpentry,
engineering, construction, driving, social work, etc.- many of the residents continue the
trade of their ancestors. The lives of the fishermen, therefore, are oriented to the sea
both socially and economically. The beach, like the streets of the PJ, is multidimensional and provides livelihood to nearly 75% of the PJ residents (Immanuell & Rao,
116

2012). The beach is a social gathering place for the fishermen. The beach has several
large sheds where the fishermen rest or where the public meetings are held, and it
provides the open space for the fishermen to store and repair their gear (boats, nets).

While the streets in the community are the social gathering spaces for the women, the
beach acts as the social bonding space for the men (Figure 22). Fishermen need large
open areas to repair their nets, rest and store their boats. Typically, in an Indian context,
women try to stay away from the streets as their presence on the streets can be
considered as being too conspicuous. In the PJ context, the absence of the men from
the streets gives leverage to the women to step into the streets and socialize. Having
their private beach provides the residents with flexibility for storing their boats, working
on their nets in an open space and allowing them to continue fishing. The beach and
access to the sea are one of the strong driving forces behind the slum residents’
perseverance to fight for their community.

Spatial Lens: How do spatial characteristics impact ongoing resilience of a
slum?
As seen in this chapter, two spatial characteristics play a central role in the long-term
transformative resilience of the PJ: the opportunity to grow and the availability of public
spaces. The PJ continued its growth after the 1980s redevelopment since the residents
had the opportunity to construct additional dwelling units either vertically or horizontally.
Since the original development scheme allotted individual lots, the residents built second
and third floors to accommodate growing families or to rent the unit for increasing the
household income. This vertical expansion allowed multi-generational families to prosper
in the community. Similarly, the physical infrastructure that was in place due to the
formal development provided incentives to extend the community further horizontally
117

albeit informally. The informal housing within the PJ is sometimes affordable and
minimalistic or in some cases high quality elaborate constructions.

The second unique spatial characteristic of the PJ is its public spaces (streets, and the
beach). Vibrant public spaces are critical for vibrant and resilient neighborhoods as they
strengthen the existing social networks. Public spaces in PJ offer a variety of functions;
they are multi-layered and multi-dimensional entities as opposed to clearly defined zones
or land uses more common in western countries. These public spaces in the PJ such as
the streets serve as pathways for public and private transport, water supply, electricity,
drainage and street lighting. These streets are venues for informal trade and social
interaction and are an extension of various household activities such as cooking,
washing and sometimes even sleeping. Similarly, the fishing beach provides a wide
variety of uses. Such as storing boats, engines and other equipment; providing large
open areas to repair the nets and boats; serving as a place for senior citizens to
socialize with their peers, and becoming a comfortable open space for the fishermen to
relax and socialize after a long day of fishing.

Overall, the spatial characteristics of the PJ create a unique, vibrant community where
the residents can practice their customs and traditions. The spatial features of the slum
address the socio-cultural, economic and infrastructural needs of the PJ residents. The
public places create a unique urban character that pushes the slum residents’ resolve to
save their community and their quality-of-life. The spatial characteristics such as the
opportunity to grow and the vibrant public spaces make the PJ more desirable to the
multiple generations in the community.

118

The temporal perspective chapter illustrated two major disasters (fire and gentrification)
that PJ faced over the past thirty years. That chapter addresses the resilience to what
question. This chapter went beyond narrating the disasters and addressed why the PJ
residents invested time, money and labor to preserve their community. The spatial
growth of the PJ and the public spaces in the PJ create a unique and livable community.
These spatial characteristics motivate the residents to fight for their community.

Chapter 7: Social Resilience: Bonding, Bridging and Linking
Networks
Social capital is often defined and explored through bonding, bridging and linking
networks (Putnam, 2000; Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Woolcock & Narayan, 2000).
Bonding relationships include ties between family members, friends or neighbors; these
are particularly close and ‘inward looking’ relationships. Bridging networks are outward
looking ‘horizontal relationships’ with similar entities. Linking relationships are vertical
linkages with organizations that can improve the quality of life within a community
(Putnam, 2000; Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Woolcock & Narayan, 2000).

Bonding social capital is the most primitive and quintessential type of informal social
network. Research has established that there are high reserves of bonding social capital
among the urban poor (Andavarapu & Arefi, 2015; Appadurai, 2001; Arefi, 2009;
Dudwick, Kuehnast, Jones, & Woolcock, 2006; Roy, 2003). For slums or individuals with
low socio-economic status, bonding social capital allows them to “get by,” but without
connecting to external agencies, they have difficulty getting ahead (Aldrich, 2011; Arefi,
2009; Woolcock & Narayan, 2000). Urban poor rely on bonding networks to survive in
the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Some examples include recovery after a flood in
Mumbai, India (Chatterjee, 2010), coping with ongoing flooding in Jakarta, Indonesia
(Wilhelm, 2011), surviving and adapting to food crises in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Keck &
Etzold, 2013).

Bridging and linking networks are linkages between slum dwellers and external
agencies. Several non-government organizations have published extensively on the how
the bridging and linking networks improve the quality of life for the poor urban residents.
Some of these scholars are Sheela Patel, founder and director of Society for Promotion
120

of Area Resource Center’s (SPARC); Celine D’cruz, co-ordinator of Shack and Slum
Dwellers International (SDI); Jockin Arputham founder of National Slum Dweller
Federation (NSDF); and Arjun Appadurai from New York University.

An example of bridging and linking network is the case of Railway slums in Mumbai,
India. In 2001, the World Bank and the Maharashtra State Government implemented a
project to improve the railway lines in Mumbai, part of the project involved resettling the
nearly 60,000 slum dwellers away from the train track. SPARC, NSDF, and Mahila Milan
educated the slum dwellers to self-organize and mobilized them to partner with the State
government in the slum rehabilitation plan. The slum dwellers gained the trust of the
World Bank & the State government. These two agencies gave slum dwellers the
opportunity to manage their resettlement program. The slum dwellers conducted a
baseline survey to determine the number of units needed, selected the site for relocation
and designed their new units with help from the professionals (Andavarapu & Arefi,
2015; Sheela Patel et al., 2002).

Another example of the bridging networks is the Mahila Milan, a women’s saving group
of pavement dwellers in Mumbai. Mahila Milan through their weekly meeting and
enumeration surveys built organizational capacity to curtail demolitions. Other slum
residents throughout India adopted the Mahila Milan model of micro savings and
enumeration surveys (d’Cruz & Mudimu, 2013). The bridging and linking networks gives
voice to the poor urban residents and provide them with an opportunity to engage in
partnership with more powerful agencies (Appadurai, 2001).

121

Current social capital scholarship focuses on the success of a single institution
(Appadurai, 2001; Arputham, 2008; d’Cruz & Mudimu, 2013) or a challenge that a
community faced (Ghertner, 2010; Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Weinstein, 2014).
However, a comprehensive analysis of social capital in communities, especially slums is
much more complex and nuanced. Slums have multiple institutions and face numerous
challenges over time. Each of the institutions within the slum plays a prominent role in
not only connecting and holding the community together but also in connecting and
collaborating with external agencies.

This dissertation aims to conduct a holistic analysis of social capital in the PJ and,
therefore, focuses on the three institutions within the PJ. This chapter analyzes the
bonding, bridging and linking capital of three institutions within the PJ. The three
institutions in the PJ are the Grama Sabha, Marine Cooperative Society (MCS) and the
Fishermen Youth Welfare Association (FYWA). Each of these institutions was created
for a different purpose, but together these institutions create a strong safety net for the
PJ residents.

Grama Sabha
The Grama Sabha is an ancient form of village assembly, which serves as an informal
law and norm enforcer and maintains the Grama kattubatlu (village discipline) through
dispute resolution and organizing religious events (Aldrich, 2011). More broadly, the
Grama Sabha maintains the community structure, rituals, and resource distribution.
Grama Sabha leadership (6 leaders) positions are hereditary and are passed down from
generation to generation. Leaders are selected from six different families for a lifetime.

122

Grama Sabhas are not official or political entities but are often recognized as the
informal leaders of the community (Aldrich, 2011). Grama Sabhas are more prevalent
and active in rural areas; PJ’s Grama Sabha is an exception since it is still active and
relevant despite being in an urban area. The homogeneity of the community and the
common occupation of fishing are the two reasons for an active Grama Sabha in the PJ.

Household survey conducted in 2009 revealed that the PJ is homogenous, where nearly
88.5% of the residents belong to the ‘Jalari’ caste (GVMC, 2009). Approximately 75% of
the PJ residents earn their income from offshore fishing (10-15 miles into the sea)
(Immanuell & Rao, 2012). The social connection built on the land saves lives on the sea.
While fishing in the deep sea, the fishermen rely on their friends and family on the
nearby boats for first aid and emergency evacuation. The socio-cultural activities, both
old and new, in the PJ strengthen the bond among the fishermen.

Bonding Capital
Research has established that there are high reserves of bonding social capital among
the urban poor (Andavarapu & Arefi, 2015; Appadurai, 2001; Arefi, 2009; Dudwick et al.,
2006; Roy, 2003). The previous research has however not addressed the role of shared
occupation (fishing in the case of PJ) in creating and retaining social capital within a
community. This dissertation illustrates that the shared occupation increases the
bonding capital among the residents. The cultures, traditions and superstitions within a
community play a pivotal role in building bonding capital among the residents.

The fishermen are very superstitious and follow traditions and ritual for a variety of
reasons, to pacify the sea, to ensure ‘bumper’ catch, and to warrant the safe return of
the fishermen (Senior citizen from the focus group 5/22/2014). The Grama Sabha is the
123

spiritual leader of the PJ and organizes religious activities such as the construction of
temples and religious festivals. Additionally, the Grama Sabha elders resolve issues
such as property distribution among family members and fights among the residents.
The Grama Sabha leaders try to maintain the peace and quiet of the community.

Temple construction, in particular through resident donations, binds the community in a
shared vision and goal. Between 1985 and 2006, Grama Sabha elders raised donations
to build four temples at the entrance of the PJ (two of them are shown in figure 24). In
2006, the residents raised $24,105 to build a Ramalayam Temple (second image in
figure 24). Which is a substantial amount for a community, where nearly all the residents
are below the poverty line and earn less than $1.25 a day (GVMC, 2009).

One of the successful fundraising campaigns for the temple construction is ‘fishing for
the temple day’, on a designated day, the fishermen in the slum donate all their fishing
catch to the Grama Sabha elders for the construction of the temple. In 2006 for the
construction of Ramalayam temple, three ‘fishing for the temple’ days were held. Slum
dwellers that are not fishermen are asked to donate cash directly for the temple
construction. After building the temple, slum dwellers, especially the fishermen, continue
to give 1% of their income for the temple upkeep.

The images in figure 25 show the festive atmosphere during the Polaramma Jatara, an
annual festival in the PJ. The Grama Sabha organizes 10-12 such events every year.
The first image shows the goddess while the second image displays the animal sacrifice
ritual at the entrance of the temple. Tsunami Day (figure 26) is another festival that
125

originated on the day of the Tsunami on December 26, 2004. The disastrous Tsunami
that caused havoc in Japan and parts of India destroyed the PJ beach along with the PJ
residents’ boats and fishing equipment. The PJ and the majority of the houses in the
slum were undisturbed. Since that day, every year the residents offer their prayers to the
sea for saving their village from destruction.

On this day, every woman and girl in the PJ carries water mixed with turmeric, milk, and
flowers on her head and offers it to the sea (Gangamma Talli/ Mother Ganga as they
lovingly call the sea) for sparing their community in the 2004 Tsunami (figure 26). The
Tsunami Day celebration is only a decade old tradition and is going strong. The start of
such a new tradition and its success illustrate the fact that the bonding capital within the
PJ is still high.

Bridging Capital
Bridging capital refers to intra-community ties or networks. Grama Sabhas are common
institutions in most of the fishing villages (Aldrich, 2011). However, they are uncommon
in urban communities, there are only a handful of Grama Sabhas in the city of
Visakhapatnam. Grama Sabhas’ from the different villages often get together to discuss
issues which are relevant to all of them, issues such as the availability of loans, the new
rules about licensing, boat registration, and problems with large mechanized boats
fishing in the areas designated for the fishermen. In some cases, these intra Grama
Sabha meetings are also conducted to mediate fights between the members of the
different communities. Several of the Grama Sabha members also maintain close
connections with other fishing villages. These informal ties and connections enhance the
collective voice of the fishermen. However, the bridging capital among the different
groups is not the goal of the Grama Sabha; their primary purpose is to continue to unite
their community through bonding activities and management of temples and rituals.

Linking Capital
The Grama Sabha had only one strong vertical linkage till date, it was with Mr. Olisetty
Chinnaya during the redevelopment. Under Mr. Olisetty Chinnaya’s leadership the
Grama Sabha was assigned as the slum’s neighborhood committee in charge of the PJ’s
redevelopment (1983-1990). As the official neighborhood committee, Grama Sabha
collaborated and connected with the government agencies in charge of the
redevelopment. The Grama Sabha leaders worked with the agencies from the design of
the redevelopment to the allocation of lots.

The recovery of the PJ was possible due to the inflow of capital from the government
agencies and Grama Sabha’s fair and transparent distribution of those resources.
127

Previous research shows that while bonding and bridging networks are adequate to get
by, these networks are not robust enough to support a community after a disaster
(Chatterjee, 2010; Islam & Walkerden, 2014; Keck & Etzold, 2013). Long-term
transformative resilience after a disaster is only plausible through linking networks, which
can connect the community with the national or international governments or other nongovernment organizations (Aldrich, 2011; Islam & Walkerden, 2014).

Despite successfully collaborating on the redevelopment, Grama Sabha could not retain
a close link or connection with the elected representatives after Olisetty Chinnaya’s
death. The Grama Sabha members try to retain close ties with their current MLA, but
these connections have not resulted in any large-scale transformations. While the PJ’s
Grama Sabha continues to be relevant and necessary for bonding and bridging within
the community, it has lost its linking capital.

Marine Cooperative Society:
Unlike the Grama Sabha, which is part of PJ’s ancient heritage, Marine Cooperative
Societies (MCS) were created by the Department of Fisheries in 1970s (Central Marine
Fisheries Research Institute, 2005). The Department intended these cooperative
societies as a link between them and the community. The lifetime membership fees of
Rs. 110 ($1.73) is set at an affordable rate to encourage fishermen to participate in these
societies.

MCS members receive benefits such as bank loans to purchase improved fishing gear
and craft; access to public fishing markets to sell the catch on better terms, i.e.,
bypassing the private fish merchants. The MCS members can also buy consumer goods

128

at a low price and above all the members or dependents receive benefits for accidental
injury and death coverage (Immanuell & Rao, 2012).

The two MCS’s in the PJ Arun-MCS and Jogi- MCS, Arun and Jogi have been elected as
presidents of these two societies since their conception in 1970s. In the past six
elections the members unanimously elected Arun and Jogi as the society presidents.
Despite having nominal fees and two long-standing MCS’s in the community, only 10.5%
(146) of the fishermen in the PJ are members of the society. The cooperative societies in
the PJ have been losing their credibility in the community since the Department of
Fisheries has reduced the number of welfare programs while consistently increasing the
licensing and registration requirements.

Bonding and Bridging
The two MCS’s in the PJ are very aware that only 10% of the fishermen in the PJ are
society members. To maintain a sense of fairness and transparency in their resource
distribution system whenever any welfare schemes are announced they distribute the
plans to the entire community irrespective of membership. If the societies receive funds
or benefits that are only sufficient for the members, the resources are divided into 15
shares and distributed to the kutumbis14. The individual kutumbi is then responsible for
distribution among its family members. By dividing up the limited number of resources
per kutumbi rather than per household, the cooperative society stretches the resources
and distributes them fairly or evenly throughout the community.

14 Kutumbis are extended kinship networks, or households with the same last name; there are 15 kutumbis in

the PJ.

129

One particular example of resource distribution is the rice program. The Department of
Fisheries prohibits fishing in the sea for 45 days to allow fish to breed. To compensate
for the lost catch, the government provides fishermen with 35 kilos of rice and Rs. 2000
($32.2) to sustain their families through the ban season. Only fishermen who are
members of the cooperative societies get the free rice. Since only 10% of the fishermen
are members, redistributing the rice among all the residents will result in less than a kilo
of rice per family. That rice is, therefore, donated to the temple, where it is cooked and
distributed as God’s offering (prasadam) to all the residents. The strong social ties
embedded within the cooperative society allow them to allocate the resources to the
entire community rather than sharing it only among the MCS members. Actions such as
these strengthen the bonding and bridging within the slum.

In recent years, the cooperative society has lost it’s standing within the PJ, as the
number of welfare schemes has reduced and legislative requirements have increased.
After the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai15, boat registration and fishing licenses
became mandatory for all the fishermen. In May 2014, the Indian Coast Guard in
Visakhapatnam seized two fishing boats due to lack of adequate registration and license
documents. The coast guard dragged these boats along the streets to a storage facility,
the boats were substantial damaged during the move (Omkar from the focus group
5/22/2014).

Both the fishing boats belonged to the PJ fishermen, so this incident rattled the PJ
residents. The fishermen needed the expertise of educated leaders to guide them

15 In 2008, 10 terrorists disguised as fishermen entered India via Mumbai’s seacoast in a fishing boat. The

terrorists killed 164 people and wounded 308. After these attacks, the Indian Coast Guard started patrolling the
seas and mandated all the fishermen to register their boats and get fishing licenses.

130

through the registration and licensing requirements. Rather than use the cooperative
societies, the fishermen consulted a new organization in their community, the Fishermen
Youth Welfare Association (FYWA). The illiteracy of the MCS leaders was not an issue
when the fishing regulations were sparse, and implementation was lax. But with new
rules and regulations, the fishermen needed the guidance of educated leaders, and the
FYWA had become more relevant and approachable for the younger fishermen.

To regain their credibility and relevance among the fishermen, a new president, Naveen,
was unanimously elected in 2014 as president of the Arun- MCS. Naveen completed the
eighth grade and is the most educated person in the cooperative society. The bonding
and bridging capital of the two MCSs are dwindling due to its inability to address the
needs of the new generation of fishermen.

Linking Capital
The purpose of the MCS’s was to act as the link between the community and the
Department of Fisheries. There is a lack of trust between the department and the
cooperative societies. The following excerpts from the MCS member and the
government officials outline the trust issues between the fishermen and government.

We are not educated so it is the duty of the government officials to guide us with
regards to any schemes or benefits that are available to us. They keep using
excuses such as no budget this month check with us the next month or this is the
end of the year and we have to tally our budget. They use these excuses but do
not provide us any funding. If we ask them loudly why are you not doing your job
they just ask us to get out of the office.
Interview with Omkar 3/22/2014
…. due to their illiteracy and alcoholism they are unable to utilize the
government services to the best possible way. Also lack of awareness but mainly
illiteracy, there are several welfare schemes but due to their lack of awareness
and illiteracy they are not availing those schemes. For example there is this issue
of registration, its a central government Mercantile act that every single boat
131

should be registered but no body is registering their boats. So if they register
their boats they can become eligible for some benefits but since they don’t have
authenticated membership they are losing some of those benefits.
Field Development Officer 03/22/2014
As seen in these excerpts, the illiterate fishermen demand a more hands-on approach
than the government officials are providing, while the government officials believe that
the fishermen are not utilizing the resources properly due to their illiteracy and
alcoholism. The link between the cooperative societies and the department has
weakened as the regulations have increased.

Fishermen Youth Welfare Association (FYWA)
FYWA is a non-government, donor-based organization. Srikanth, Akhil and Raghav are
the founding members and are the executive board members of FYWA. Action Aid, an
international NGO, is one of their major donors of FYWA. In 2001, the focus of FYWA
was to improve the sanitation and drainage within the community. By 2014, FYWA’s
expanded its scope to fight illegal developments within the coastal protection zone.
Currently, it organizes workshops to teach new techniques to fishermen and to educate
the fishermen and women in the community about new laws and regulations such as
'Domestic-help abuse prevention law', 'Informal workers unions' and others. Through
their women’s wing, FYWA manages several micro-savings groups. It also helps the
fishermen with boat registrations and fishing licenses and assists them in navigating
bureaucratic hurdles.

FYWA is currently seeking to expand its reach and income by creating a new a
membership based fishermen trade union. Registering the fishermen trade union will
extend social security benefits to all the members through the legislation titled,
132

‘Unorganized Workers Social Security Act’ adopted by the State of Andhra Pradesh in
2008.

Bonding Capital
The Grama Sabha has historically been part of the PJ. It has high reserves of bonding
capital in the community due to its involvement in the religious festivals, construction of
temples and its role as the village elders. Similarly, the marine cooperative society,
which started in the 1970s, built its bonding capital through the distribution of welfare
schemes. Compared to those two institutions, the FYWA is still in its infancy. FYWA's
bonding capital is relatively low especially with the senior fishermen who consider the
FYWA leaders, as ‘arrogant young men’ (Senior citizen focus group meeting 5/22/2014).

Even with its low bonding capital, the FYWA is not afraid of taking unpopular steps such
as closing nearly 13 illegal liquor/alcohol shops within the community. Alcoholism is
epidemic in PJ, and while closing these shops allowed for a substantial reduction in
alcohol consumption. However, the move itself was very unpopular with the slum
dwellers, some of who threatened to physically harm the FYWA members for closing the
stores. Following are excerpts from an interview about the consequences of closing
illegal liquor shops in the PJ area.

DA: What percent of income do they (fishermen) spend on alcohol?
Raghav: They (the fishermen) easily spend 50% of their income on alcohol
without thinking. They forget all their responsibilities, buying food or paying
school fees. None of those are important to them while drinking, they just spend
all their money on alcohol. We had nearly 13 illegal alcohol shops in Pedda
Jalaripeta. We closed all those liquor shops.
DA: Did you see any difference in the community after closing the belt shops?
Raghav: A huge difference, there is a lot of difference. Previously the fishermen
used to come back from fishing and directly go to the belt shop (alcohol) but now
133

that we closed all the illegal alcohol shops in area, so after fishing they typically
don’t have the energy to walk all the way out of the village to get a drink. So there
has been a huge drop in alcohol consumption.
Raghav during focus group with FYWA 04/02/2014
Illegal liquor shops without proper licenses sell cheap liquor, which can be a health
hazard. The above conversation shows that the FYWA members are not afraid to take
steps that might be unpopular with the slum residents. Despite these setbacks, FYWA
improved its social standing with the younger fishermen, because they recognize FYWA
as a vital link between them and external agencies. For example, when the fishermen
were required to register their boats and get fishing licenses through the Department of
Fisheries, they approached the FYWA members to help them navigate the bureaucratic
process. Similarly, when the Department of Fisheries had a welfare scheme where the
fishermen were eligible to get iceboxes at half the market value, the department
approached the FYWA to spread the word in the community and help the residents with
the application process.

Bridging Capital
Since its inception in 2001 FYWA was part of Keratam (Keratam translates to sea wave).
Keratam is a bridging network between fishermen organizations in the Visakhapatnam
area. Keratam encourages community-to-community exchange visits to innovate and act
together. By 2011, the network had established a presence in nearly 40 fishing villages
around the city of Visakhapatnam (Equations, 2008; Philipose, 2013).

Keratam builds partnerships with official agencies to strengthen and support their
organization and when necessary the network challenges the official position through
judicial action. In 2003, the Keratam filed a lawsuit in the State of Andhra Pradesh High
Court, against the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA), arguing that a
134

proposed road widening violated the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)16 notification. The
court case halted the project for three years and the project was eventually shelved
(Equations, 2008; Philipose, 2013). In 2006, the Keratam network, including FYWA, filed
a court case in the Andhra Pradesh High Court against the GVMC and VUDA regarding
new constructions in the CRZ. The high court ordered the GVMC and VUDA to demolish
all the new construction in Visakhapatnam’s CRZ area (Equations, 2008).

Bridging networks like Keratam have emerged in a variety of urban poor groups in India.
For example, the Slum Dweller Federation based in Mumbai (which is a network of slum
dwellers across India). Similarly, Mahila Milan, a national network of urban poor women
that encourages micro savings & slum enumeration surveys. Shack/Slum Dwellers
International or SDI, is an international network of community-based organizations of the
urban poor in 33 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America (Patel et al., 2002). These
horizontal networks of poor have gained international recognition due to their unorthodox
approach to urban poverty. Appadurai’s (2001) oft-cited article on Deep Democracy
purports that these lateral connections empower the urban poor.

Linking Capital
FYWA’s early success and recognition are credited in part to their partnership with
Action Aid. Action Aid funds FYWA and the other fishermen organizations in the
Keratam network. Action Aid is an international organization, which works with over 15
million people in 45 countries. The agency believes in fighting poverty and inequality
through empowering individuals and through collective action (Philipose, 2013).

16

Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) order under the Government of India’s Environment Protection Act, became
law in 1991. The law aimed to protect and conserve the environment of the coastal regions

135

During late 1990s Action Aid partnered with a local NGO in Visakhapatnam and started
training volunteers about right-based activism. Action Aid trains its volunteers and
fellows in a human rights-based approach where the term beneficiary is replaced with
the term rights holder. Action Aid envisaged a long-term presence in the Visakhapatnam
area and made a transformative impact on the fishing community taking their collective
struggles to the next level (Philipose, 2013).

Unlike FYWA members, the Grama Sabha, and the MCS leaders are illiterate and,
therefore, depend on the government officials or the elected representatives to navigate
bureaucratic processes (e.g.: boat registration, applying for loans or fishing licenses).
The rights-based approach promoted by action aid overwhelms the PJ’s older generation
leaders (Grama Sabha and MCS). The FYWA members, who are trained under the
rights based philosophy are willing to challenge the government officials in court for their
human rights, their fishing rights and their community rights.

Through the link with Action Aid, the PJ today has a new generation of leaders who are
confident, perceptive and undaunted by the either government red tape or private
interests. Action Aid has injected massive doses of knowledge and confidence into the
FYWA and other fishermen organizations across the Visakhapatnam Coast line and
transformed the fishermen community from one of subdued illiterate urban poor to a
shrewd political machine that is willing to fight tooth and nail to protect the quality of life
in their community. The close link between the international NGO and the local
fishermen is critical to this transformation.

136

What is the Social Capital and Resilience nexus?
Current research on social capital in slums has focused on illustrating that high reserves
of social capital allow a community or a slum to survive a challenge. However, building
social capital is a lengthy complicated endeavor. This chapter analyzed the process of
building social capital through exploring the bonding, bridging and linking capital of three
institutions in the PJ.

PJ’s bonding capital is rooted in the homogeneity of the community (‘jalari’ caste) and
the shared occupation (fishing). Other activities in the community such as the religious
ceremonies, temple construction and distribution of welfare schemes strengthen the ties
within the community. The downside of the high bonding capital within the PJ is the ‘us’
vs. ‘them’ attitude between the fishermen and the non-fishermen (less than 6%) in the
community. The fishermen call the non-fishermen in the community 'outers'. There is no
open hostility between the two groups, but the non-fishermen do not participate in any of
the bonding activities, such as religious ceremonies, temple construction, feasts on the
streets and others.

While bonding capital strengthens the bonds within the community, bridging & linking
capital alter the political and policy landscape, these networks substantially improve the
quality of life for the urban poor (Boonyabancha, 2005; S. Patel & Arputham, 2007; S.
Patel, 2013). This chapter explored the origins, strength and limitations of the social
capital of the three institutions in the PJ. As seen in this chapter, PJ residents use their
social capital not just to cope and adapt, but to transform to a better physical, social,
human and ecological state.

137

The transformative resilience of a slum is based on the perseverance of the slum
residents to preserve their physical, human, social and ecological resources. Slum
residents, however, need links to external agencies, which can provide them with the
tools or knowledge and resources to preserve their community. The PJ residents forged
new connections or links to external networks and resources to build the resilience of
their community. The PJ survived two challenges over the past forty years due to the
ability of the residents to connect or link with external agencies.

PJ not only survived but also transformed to a better physical, human, social and
ecological state after the 1983 fire due to the link between Grama Sabha and Mr.
Olisetty Chinnaya. The physical transformation provided the space and scope for
human enrichment and improved social bonding through retaining existing social
networks and ensured direct access to the beach for the fishermen (ecological
resource).

Similarly, when faced with gentrification threats that challenged the community’s
affordability and threatened the residents access to the beach, the FYWA used legal
measures and media to fight those threats. Action Aid educated and empowered the
younger fishermen in the community to fight against these gentrification threats (Human
& Social capital). This chapter illustrates that the long-term ongoing resilience of the PJ
is based on the malleability of the community to learn new skills and adapt to multiple
challenges, which is possible only when the community engages with an external
agency.

Conclusion: A Resilient Slums Framework
As is evident through the PJ case study presented in this dissertation, resilience in urban
slums is a process rather than a subjective or objective ‘thing’. Study of resilience in
urban slums is the understanding of the interplay between different forms of thinking,
doing and acting. This dissertation used a temporal lens to narrate the evolution of the
PJ over the past sixty years (chapter 5). The spatial lens observed the geographical
aspects of the PJ that created a unique and livable community (chapter 6). Finally, the
social lens analyzed the role of social networks (bonding, bridging and linking) in the
ongoing resilience of the slum (chapter 7). By deconstructing and exploring resilience in
terms of time-space-social dimensions, this dissertation redefines the dialectic
understanding of resilience in urban slums. This multi-perspective view of resilience
challenges the notion of slum dwellers as passive disaster victims and redirects the
focus on to their ingenuity and adaptability to overcome external circumstances or
disasters.

Resilient Slums Framework
Chapter 3 explored various definitions of resilience in urban planning literature and
identified the ‘Social Resilience’ definition as an appropriate framework to study slums.
As discussed in chapter 3, social resilience definition portrays resilience as having three
dimensions (coping, adapting and transformation). Chelleri et al., (2015) visually
illustrate the social resilience definition through the ‘ball in a basin’ metaphor.

140

Figure 28: Three Dimensions of Resilience: Coping/recovery, Adaptation and
Transformation

Source: Adapted from Chelleri et al, 2015, p. 187

Figure 28 presents this conceptual scheme focusing on the dynamic nature of a system
state (Chelleri et al., 2015). Along the time axis (from short-term to long-term), each
approach is presented in relation to the system threshold and stress.

The ball

represents the system in question (slums in this dissertation), and the basin represents
the steady state of resilience.

The first dimension is the recovery perspective. Recovery is indeed mainly related to
system shocks (internal or external) and is rooted in the engineering resilience view (i.e.
bouncing back to the original state). The second dimension is the adaptation, understood
as the process of adjustment prior to the disaster: here the system boundaries are
moved/ adjusted so that the system persists within the same regime. The third
dimension is the longer-term structural transformation (transitions), which refers to the
141

alteration of fundamental attributes of the system, to allow the community to enter a new
regime. Shifting adaptation towards this transition to new regimes is a critical and
complex socio-political choice and usually happens once the system approaches
dangerous thresholds.

The scholarly literature to date has substantially documented the coping/recovery and
adaptive resilience of slum dwellers (Ajibade et al., 2013; Braun & Aßheuer, 2011;
Chatterjee, 2010; Keck & Etzold, 2013). On the other hand, the complex and nuanced
nature of transformative resilience of slums is underexplored. Slum transformations are
only possible when the communities have access to basic infrastructures such as water,
sewer and electricity. Such transformation is not possible without external support.

Slum transformations or slum redevelopments are controversial due to political, social
and ecological issues. Chapter 2 analyzed four types of slum redevelopment policies.
Only two of those policies (Type 2: Self-help and Type 3: Enablement) acknowledge the
importance of social capital in the transformation of slums. The PJ is a unique slum,
where both the Type 2 and Type 3 slum redevelopment policies were used
consecutively.

Type 2- slum redevelopment policy refers to John Turner’s self-help program where the
government provides serviced lots, and the residents construct their individual units.
After the 1983 fire, Andhra Pradesh state government redeveloped the PJ based on
John Turner’s self-help slum redevelopment policy (Type 2). The state government
created serviced lots (water, sewer, electricity and roads) and provided limited funding
and construction material to the residents. The residents invested their personal funds
and built their houses.
142

Type 3-slum redevelopment policy refers to enablement, where NGO’s educate and train
slum residents about their rights. Starting in late 1990, international NGO Action Aid
entered the PJ community to enable and educate the youth. Through the enablement
and training, the youth leaders in the PJ fought against development that encroached on
their community. Over a four-decade period, the PJ residents collaborated with
government and non-government organizations to transform their community physically
and socially.

The objective of this dissertation is to document and understand the transformative
resilience of the PJ. I proposed three research questions to explore this research
objective:

1. Resilience to What? What are the disasters that the PJ faced over the past four
decades?
2. Why Resilience, why do slum dwellers fight for their communities?
3. Resilience, How? How do communities with minimal resources survive multiple
challenges?

Temporal resilience (chapter 5) addressed the first research question through a
chronological narration of the trials and triumphs that the PJ residents faced over the
past four decades. This chapter demonstrated that the spatial and the social
characteristics of PJ are unique and play a significant role in transformative resilience of
the slum. Chapter 6 elucidates that the opportunity to grow physically and the public
open spaces create a sense of place among the residents and motivates them to
preserve their community. Chapter 7 illustrated that the PJ residents collaborated with

143

the external agencies and transformed the slum both physically and socially over the
past four decades.

Ethnographic case study of PJ using a multi-pronged and multidimensional approach
provided a unique, comprehensive and holistic understanding of the transformative
resilience of the slums. As illustrated in Figure 29 the Resilient Slums Framework
derived from this unique case study offers an in-depth understanding of the role of
evolution, spatial characteristics and social capital in transformative resilience.

Temporal resilience answers the what, when and where questions regarding the
challenges that the community faced. Whereas, spatial resilience responds to the why
question, why did the residents fight for their community? And social resilience responds
to the how question? How do slum dwellers with minimal resources fight against natural

144

or man-made disasters? These three perspectives provide a deeper insight into the
resilience of a community.

The majority of communities can survive or cope with a disaster, but communities that
can adapt and transform in the midst of ongoing challenges are resilient temporally.
Spatial resilience refers to the community’s ability to accommodate newer generations
while retaining the social and cultural identity of the community. Even when residents
want to fight for their communities, their efforts do not always succeed. Many poor urban
neighborhoods in New Orleans did not revive after Katrina. Only neighborhoods with
linking networks to external agencies survived Katrina (Elliott et al, 2010). The social
resilience refers to the how question, how can communities with meager resources fight
and survive these disasters? Horizontal networks are essential to surviving disasters or
challenges on an ongoing basis. However, communities can only survive larger disasters
through collaborations with external government or non-government organizations.

Key Findings
The key findings from this dissertation are as follows:

1.

Transformative Resilience: Academic and policy debates, on one end, portray
slums as signs of underdevelopment - a series of problems evident in their most
extreme form in exploding mega cities – a planet of slums (Davis, 2006; UNHabitat, 2003). At the other end of the spectrum, the slums are seen as evidence
of

creativity,

ecological

superiority,

romanticized

entrepreneurialism

and

adaptability (Appadurai, 2001; Boonyabancha, 2009; De Soto, 2000). The PJ
case study shows that a slum, which was at one end of the spectrum
(underdeveloped), can transition to the other end of the spectrum. This case
145

study illustrates that the physical and social infrastructure of slums can be
transformed.

2.

Fighting Gentrification: Three of the top tourist attractions in the city of
Visakhapatnam are close to the PJ: a 55 acre historical VUDA Park; a 380-acre
hilltop park Tenneti Park and Kailashgiri; and the popular Rama Krishna Beach
(RK Beach) (figure 21). There have been multiple attempts in the past 14 years
to redevelop the PJ as a tourist destination. The slum residents used a twopronged approach to defy those attempts. First the FYWA thwarted large-scale
projects through its media outreach and legal filings when necessary. Two, the
PJ residents prevented piecemeal re-development of their community by not
selling their property to outsiders (non-fishing families) (Venkat from the focus
group 5/22/2014). The social capital that the residents built through mutual
investment in the community (temples) and cultural/religious activities (feasts and
religious ceremonies) generated a sense of trust among the residents thereby
reducing the probability of piecemeal redevelopment of the community by
outsiders. Additionally, the high social capital within the community pressured the
government officials or politicians to save the low-income fishing village.

3.

Multi-perspective Analysis of Transformative Resilience: Chapter 4 of this
dissertation operationalized transformative resilience based on the physical,
human, social and ecological capital. This dissertation also analyzed these four
capitals using three different perspectives: Temporal, Spatial and Social. This
multi-perspective analysis illustrates that the resilience of the PJ is rooted in its
spatial and social growth. As long as a community can grow spatially, evolve and
146

find new social organizations to withstand new challenges, it can innovate,
reinvent and collaborate to fight external challenges.

Resilience of a slum is resilience of its people: The residents of the PJ
survived two natural disasters (Fire and 2004 Tsunami) over the past 40 years.
The residents continue to fight tourism-oriented developments that threaten their
quality of life. The perseverance of the residents to fight for their community is
rooted in the fact that community is desirable and important to a new generation
of residents. The PJ provides several spatial benefits (affordable housing, publicprivate space and access to the beach for fishing) and social advantages
(cultural and religious bonds and direct links to external agencies). Overall, the
resilience of the PJ is rooted in the fact that it is a livable and vibrant community.
A slum can only be as resilient if the people living in it are willing to fight for their
community.

147

5.

Slums when redeveloped in collaboration with the community can be
resilient in the long term. The PJ is a testament to the fact that the physical
and human capital of slums can be improved while preserving the social and
ecological assets of the community. Thirty years after the redevelopment, the
community continues to be desirable and loved by a younger generation which is
willing to invest time, energy and resources to preserve and protect it.

6.

Transformative Resilience is under explored. A 2016 review article evaluated
four decades of academic literature (172 unique publications) on urban resilience
(Meerow, 2016). The article identified 25 definitions of urban resilience in the
literature. Majority (13 out of 25) of these articles discuss only the coping capacity
of a community after a disaster. A few (5 out of 25) mention adaptive capacity
and seven discuss the transformative capacity (Meerow, 2016). The literature
review clearly shows that transformative resilience is under explored in literature.
This dissertation aims to address this gap in the academic scholarship with
regards to transformative resilience in urban areas through analyzing the PJ’s
physical and social transformation.

7.

Holistic, longitudinal analysis of resilience. Literature on urban resilience
(Chatterjee, 2010; Braun & Aßheuer, 2011; Keck & Etzold, 2013) or social capital
often focuses on one single disaster (Ghertner, 2010; Islam &Walkerden, 2014;
Weinstein, 2014) that a community faced. In contrast, this dissertation evaluated
the multiple disasters that the PJ faced over the past four decades. This research
shows that communities have to constantly evolve and create new linkages with
external agencies to survive new threats.
148

8.

The ‘what’, ‘why’, and ‘how’ of resilience. The three perspectives of resilience
(temporal, spatial and social) discussed in this dissertation address three
questions with regards to resilience. The temporal perspective (chapter 5)
narrated the disasters that the PJ community faced over four decades. While the
spatial (chapter 6) and social perspectives (chapter 7) illustrated the why and
how a community with minimal knowledge and monetary resources survived
these disasters. These three questions provided a deeper and meaningful
analysis of resilience of the PJ.

Future Research
Urban poor are not vulnerable victims; they can be fearsome warriors who can fight for
their human rights, their community rights and their cultural rights. Slums can be resilient
temporally, spatially and socially. The multi-perspective conception of resilience
proposed in this dissertation challenges the view of slum dwellers as passive disaster
victims and focuses on their ingenuity and adaptability to overcome external
circumstances. This section will discuss the opportunities and directions for future
research based on this unique case study.

Five months after completing my fieldwork, in October 2014, a category four cyclone
Hudhud devastated the entire PJ. Hudhud cyclone destroyed 150 houses in the PJ and
most of the fishermen in the community lost their boats. Fortunately, no lives were lost
since the local government evacuated all the residents to safe houses before the cyclone
struck the area. As of March 2016, eighteen months after the disaster many of the
residents who lost their homes still haven’t received any support to rebuild their houses.
Without the necessary external support, these families are struggling to rebound after
149

the cyclone. Therefore, the first avenue for future research is continuing the
ethnographic qualitative research in the PJ to understand how the community responded
to this natural disaster. The focus of this future research will be on how the PJ and the
fishermen have fared after the Hudhud cyclone.

The PJ was redeveloped using both Type 2 and Type 3 slum redevelopment policies as
described in Chapter 2.. These two slum redevelopment policies changed the entire
physical and social landscape of the PJ. Future research can explore if the other types of
slum redevelopment policies (Type 1 and Type 4) had a similar impact and whether
these impacts changes based on the geographic location. A holistic analysis of all the
four types of slum redevelopment policies across different cultures would be an
invaluable tool for decision makers. The second avenue for future research is using the
multi-perspective conception of resilience proposed in this dissertation to analyze the
150

long-term transformative resilience in other slums across the world that were
redeveloped using one or more of these slum redevelopment policies.

A third direction for future research is examining the applicability of the multi-perspective
resilience model in the context of poor urban neighborhoods in the United States. For
example, applying this multi-perspective, ethnographic and qualitative analysis to study
Cincinnati’s Over the Rhine neighborhood (OTR) or other inner city neighborhoods will
provide a unique opportunity to define and understand urban resilience in diverse
geographical and social conditions. Using the three-lens approach (Temporal, Spatial,
and Social) to study transformative resilience in diverse locations, provide an opportunity
to further enhance the understanding of urban resilience in a US context.

The PJ case study illustrated that collaborations with government and non-government
agencies can transform slums to a better physical and social standing. This dissertation
shows how resilience works at the local level. Creation of a resilient slum should take
into account the need for creating strong institutions or organizations that provide the
required linkages between the community and those with power. A resilient city or a
resilient slum can only be possible when the social, political and infrastructural needs of
the residents are met.

This dissertation demonstrates that resilience on the ground is a long and laborious
process. The residents invested time, money and labor to rebuild their community from
ground up. The PJ case is an exception in that it was able to access linkage capital at
two different critical times in its history. Accessing linkage capital is not possible for all
urban slums especially when governments consider them as a hindrance to urban
development (Bhan, 2009). When governments and city municipalities reject the
151

subalterns’ claims on urban space, the urban poor’s hardships are further exacerbated
(Datta, 2012).

Informal small-scale businesses including traditional fishermen are being fought against
and displaced, which leads to the marginalization of the informal economy and
contributes to the restructuring of the informal sector. Today aesthetics and
beautification have become essential criteria for urban governance and discursively
marginalizing and physically displacing the traditional elements of the urban economy
are considered modernization.

This dissertation seeks to offer, if not an entirely new idea, then perhaps a new way to
approach a timeworn idea. Thus, an argument is made that the concept of resilience is
very relevant to understanding urban slums, and this notion can be enhanced and
meaningfully grounded through an in-depth ethnographic review of a resilient slum.
Resilience is not a new idea - it is an innovation springing into the world fully formed- but
it is an ancient feature characteristic of how we go about living, surviving and thriving
(Rogers, 2012). The goal of this dissertation is to merge theory with empirical evidence
about how slums and slum dwellers survive and thrive in the midst of ongoing disasters.
