Abstract

Of the approximate 2.5 million homeless children in the United States in 2014, over half were
under the age of 6 (America’s Youngest Outcasts: A Report Card on Child Homelessness, 2014).
Adversities associated with homelessness are risks to early developmental trajectories. Play is a
primary medium for early learning and serves as a protective mechanism for children facing
cumulative risk factors associated with homelessness. Homeless shelters often lack supportive
environments critical to eliciting stimulating healthy play interactions. The purpose of this
exploratory case study was to uncover mothers’ perceptions of young children’s play in the
context of a Midwestern urban core residential homeless shelter for women and children through
interviews, observations and field notes, and photo elicitation. The research question to be
answered was: How is play perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of a
residential homeless shelter for women and children? Data analysis indicated mothers perceived
that play fostered children's healthy growth and development, play was viewed as a time of
respite for mothers, and play afforded children opportunities to be free from adult problems.
Additionally, findings indicated the contextual nature of the shelter constrained rather than
facilitated children's play, thereby compounding family stress. Six themes that emerged from the
study and implications for policy, practice, and future research are presented and discussed.

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
PLAY IN THE LIVES OF YOUNG CHILDREN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS:
AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY
Chapter 1
Introduction to the Study
The national economic downturn, coupled with systemic racial and ethnic disparities,
contributed to an estimated 2.5 million children in the United States experiencing homelessness
in 2014. Fifty-one percent of those children were under the age of 6 (America’s Youngest
Outcasts: A Report Card on Child Homelessness, 2014). Unique factors associated with family
homelessness compound the negative impacts of poverty, placing a child’s developmental
trajectory and thus future outcomes at risk.
Beginning in 2007, the United States has seen an increase in the number of families and
children experiencing homelessness (Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness, 2013).
Over 67,000 families were recorded as homeless during the annual “point in time count” in
January of 2014 (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2015). Family homelessness has been
described as a set of circumstances severely restricting parents’ capacity to obtain basic
necessities and adequately support children’s cognitive, social, emotional and physical needs
(Swick, 2009).
Due to adversities associated with homelessness, young children often face limited
opportunities for quality play experiences. Play has long been established as the primary medium
for early childhood learning (Bodrova & Leong, 1996; Gray, 2011; Piaget, 1968; Vygotsky,
1978). Play is not only a vehicle for optimal early learning; quality play interactions also
promote the development of non-academic competencies including trust, empathy, agency, and
resilience (Erikson, 1963; Piaget, 1962; Sutton-Smith, 1997; Vygotsky, 1978). The link between

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
the quality of play experiences and early development and overall life outcomes is often
misunderstood by the general public and among the very systems responsible for educating and
caring for families and children (Elkind, 1981, 1987; Nwokah, Hsu, & Gulker, 2013; National
Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000). A lack of supportive stimulating play
experiences early in life can manifest to deprive children of opportunities to learn and develop.
In other words, children’s capacity for gaining new knowledge and building fundamental skills
associated with future outcomes is undermined when deprived of nurturing play environments
(Brown, 2005; Fisher, 1992; Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012).
There is scant literature on the contextual nature of homeless shelters serving families
with young children birth to 5 years old. Specifically, studies focused on the contextual nature
and dynamics of young children’s play in homeless shelters were not found in a thorough review
of the literature. This discovery clearly illuminated a gap in the research. Homeless shelters vary
widely in available resources and capacity to appropriately meet the complex needs of families
with young children. Consequently, it can be surmised that opportunities for play are undermined
or supported depending on ecological factors inherent in shelters serving families experiencing
homelessness. An exploratory case study of mothers’ perceptions of young children’s play in the
context of a homeless shelter can reveal details of families’ lived realities as they pertain to play
supports and barriers. Findings from this dissertation research can be used as a catalyst for
discussions of policy and practice initiatives to facilitate improvements in the support and care of
families with young children experiencing homelessness at the programmatic and organizational
levels within the homeless services delivery systems.
The scope of literature on family homelessness has historically focused on physiological,
psychological, and academic effects of homelessness on school age children (Masten, 1991;

2

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Masten, Miliotis, Graham-Bermann, Ramirez, & Neemann, 1993). Over time, researchers in the
field of homelessness broadened their focus to include studies of infants, toddlers and preschool
children (Buckner, 2008; Fantuzzo, LoBoeuf, Brumley, & Perlman, 2013; Hinton & Cassel,
2013; Kilmer, Cook, Crusto, Strater, & Haber, 2012; Swick, 2010). Findings from these recent
studies provided implications for more in-depth investigations into the lived experiences of
homeless families and children. The extended literature concerning homelessness, play and child
development provides scant information with regard to the nature of children’s play experiences
in the context of homeless shelters.
Brief mention of play can be found within scholarly literature of the effects of
homelessness on aspects of children’s daily lives (Buckner, 2008; Hinton & Cassel, 2013; Swick,
2010). Results from an investigation of the impacts of homelessness on young children and
families suggested that shelter “conditions are probably an especially important factor in
moderating the impact of homelessness for a child” (Buckner, 2008, p. 731). In light of this
understanding, scholars actively pursued research on the nature of child homelessness. For
example, Kilmer, et al., (2012) and Fantuzzo et al., (2013) called for efforts to more fully
comprehend the varied contextualized factors related to early childhood homelessness. Kilmer et
al., (2012) suggested a need for more family focused services, and recommended further research
of specific factors associated with parent-child relationships during episodes of homelessness.
Hinton and Cassel (2013) investigated families’ needs and detailed implications for educators to
serve as liaisons for families requiring specific services. The authors suggested providing
children with opportunities to engage in literacy activities, and play with stimulating natural
materials such as “water and sand” (p. 461).

3

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
In their 2013 article, Fantuzzo, et al., drew attention to the important role of early
intervention services for young children and families experiencing homelessness. Investigations
of play and homelessness from the field of play therapy were also found during the literature
review. Studies of therapeutic play intervention approaches were conducted to explore possible
ameliorating effects of play therapy on young children and families experiencing homelessness
(Baggerly, 2009; Carter, 2015; Cosgrove & Norris-Shortle, 2015). One study explicitly focused
on the play of unaccompanied street children. The investigation was an exploration of
Columbian street children’s play (Tyler, Holiday, Tyler, Echeverry, & Zea 1987). The research
centered on the role of play in children’s daily lives on the streets of Bogota, Columbia—yet
again the research was not directly related to the study of young children’s play in a shelter
setting. In spite of the published research on the topic of child and family homelessness, the state
of scholarly literature of young children and play in the context of homeless shelters continues to
be absent. This omission causes potential implications for effectively meeting the needs of
families with young children experiencing homelessness.
Researchers have studied particular factors related to family homelessness, such as
academic outcomes, child wellbeing, and therapeutic play, however the dynamics and the
contextual nature of young children’s play in homeless shelters has been overlooked. Study
findings pointed to a lack of effective resources and services capable of supporting the complex
needs of families and young children experiencing trauma and stress associated with
homelessness. To understand the lived experiences of and to improve services for women and
young children experiencing homelessness, research of the dynamic and contextualized nature of
play in homeless shelters deserves consideration.

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
In light of the dearth of information currently available, this dissertation research focused
on the nature of young children’s play in a homeless shelter. The purpose of this investigation
was to gain a more explicit understanding of young children’s play experiences in the context of
a homeless shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness. A qualitative
methodology was chosen so that rich descriptive details of the contextualized nature of the lived
experiences of mothers and children experiencing homelessness could be gathered. To obtain
information explicitly regarding play in homeless shelters, this qualitative case study informed
by Yin (2003), and grounded in social constructivist theory (Vygotsky, 1978), sought to explore
how play was perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness within the context of a homeless
shelter for women and children. To begin the process of piecing together a comprehensive
understanding of young children’s play in homeless shelters, the research question asked was,
How is play perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of a residential
homeless shelter for women and children?
Findings from case study research have been used to depict the unique and complex
circumstances of families living in poverty and homelessness. In one such study, Nunez (2001)
described a stark portrait of homeless families in New York City; detailing strategies capable of
alleviating the most urgent needs uncovered in the investigation. Hinton and Cassel (2013)
investigated the experiences of eight families with young children experiencing homelessness.
Findings indicated the need for shelters to provide more developmentally appropriate resources.
Authors discussed implications for early childhood education programs serving families
experiencing homelessness.
This exploratory single-case study gathered rich descriptions of the phenomenon of
young children’s play. The purpose of the study was to examine mothers’ perceptions of young

5

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
children’s play in a homeless shelter serving women and children. Study findings can be utilized
as a catalyst for initiatives at the homeless services program and systems levels, towards
improvements in policies and practices for caring for families experiencing homelessness.
Positive play experiences not only foster skills necessary for later academic success, but act as a
pathway toward healing from adversity and trauma. Nurturing play environments offer parents
and children opportunities for respite from stress, strengthening healthy relationships, thus
fostering optimal neurobiological development and overall outcomes for young children and
families experiencing homelessness.
Rationale for Research Approach
The research design was rooted in a social constructivist theoretical paradigm (Vygotsky,
1978). Through this lens the researcher was able to effectively investigate participant perceptions
of daily reality by gathering the constructed meanings participants assigned to their lived
experiences. To more fully understand how mothers experiencing homelessness perceived play
in a homeless shelter, an exploratory single-case study design (Yin, 2003) was selected to answer
the research question: How is play perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the
context of a residential homeless shelter for women and children?
Philosophical Foundation. This research was grounded in a social constructivist
paradigm (Vygotsky, 1978). According to Vygotsky (1978) experiences occur in socially
constituted contexts; and individual constructions of reality stem from interactions within the
environment. In other words, mental constructs (schemas) are formulated through experiences
and interactions taking place in daily life. Children’s play experiences and mothers’ perceptions
of the nature of children’s play within the context of a homeless shelter are influenced by varying
micro and macro factors within a socially constructed environment. For example, individual

6

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
characteristics of the parents, child, shelter administration, staff and volunteers; community
resources (outreach programs, health providers etc.); and the larger cultural and historical
variables affect the quality of the experiences children have in the context of a homeless shelter
(Swick, 2006). Using the framework of Yin’s case study design (2009), the researcher employed
exploratory single-case study methodology to obtain an understanding of the constructed
meanings mothers’ ascribed to play in the context of a homeless shelter. Focusing on mothers’
perceptions of play, the researcher was able to gather distinctive and nuanced details of the
dynamic and contextual factors acting as opportunities or barriers to play as it was experienced
by families residing in the shelter.
Theoretical Framework. This research was grounded in a social constructivist paradigm
(Vygotsky, 1978). Working from a social constructivist approach, it was understood that
individuals act within “…socially constituted environments and these interactions form the basis
of their experiences” (Freeman & Mathison, 2009). Children’s play in the context of a homeless
shelter is influenced by multiple micro and macro factors working in concert within the child’s
environment. For example, the individual characteristics of the parents, child, shelter
administration, staff and volunteers; community resources (outreach programs, health providers
etc.); and the larger cultural variables directly or indirectly affect children’s play experiences in
homeless shelters (Swick, 2006). In order to begin to understand variables that support and
constrain children’s play in homeless shelters, the researcher interviewed mothers and observed
young children residing in a local homeless shelter. By collecting mothers’ perceptions of play,
the researcher was able to gather details of the phenomenon of play in a homeless shelter.
The dissertation includes the following chapters: The introduction, literature review,
methodology, findings, and conclusion. The introduction is an overview of the research

7

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
investigation. Chapter 2, the literature review, is divided into three sections. The first section
provides a summary of the topic of family homelessness and children’s play in the United States.
The second section is a detailed discussion of the unique characteristics related to child
homelessness. The third section consists of a descriptive overview of play and the vital role it
serves in young children’s healthy growth and development. Chapter 3 covers the research
methodology, and provides a discussion of the theoretical and substantive frameworks, and case
study methodology and data collection methods. Case study methodology informed by Yin
(2009) was utilized to guide the design of the investigation from data collection through the
analysis phase. Chapter 4 details the study findings, and includes narrative reports and tables and
figures depicting results from data analysis. The fifth and final chapter consists of a synthesis of
case study findings, a discussion of study limitations related to scope and trustworthiness,
implications of findings to inform positive changes at the homeless services program level, and
recommendations for future research aimed at systemic level improvements across homeless
services organizations.
Definitions of Key Terms
The following are terms operationally defined as they were used in the study:
Emergency shelter in this study referred to a facility designed to house people experiencing
homelessness. People residing in emergency shelters have nowhere to live, and would literally be
living on the streets if it were not for the spaces provided at a facility. The 2010 Census defined
emergency and transitional shelters (i.e., shelters with sleeping facilities) as places where people
experiencing homelessness stay overnight (Symens Smith, A., Holmberg, C., & Jones-Puthof,
M., 2012).

8

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Homeless(ness). Individuals without a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence are
considered to be homeless, and include individuals living in shelters, and those sharing housing
with others (doubled-up) due to lack of economic resources (McKinney-Vento Act, 2000).
Play. Play is a complex phenomenon and difficult to precisely define, however there are
five key characteristics generally accepted within the field of study. The primary characteristics
of the play process include: culturally framed, “intrinsically motivated, freely chosen,
pleasurable, nonliteral, and actively engaged” (Hughes, 2010, p.4-5; Children’s Play Information
Service, 2009).
Stably housed peers. Individuals with consistent, permanent housing, of similar socioeconomic status as individuals experiencing homelessness. (Institute for Children, Poverty and
Homelessness, 2013).
Chapter 2
Literature Review
The population of homeless in the U. S. is primarily composed of veterans, families with
young children, single adults, seniors, and unaccompanied youth. Periods of homelessness
include short-term, long-term, and chronic. Social perception of homelessness has not kept pace
with the changing nature of the fundamental characteristics of the condition over time. The
image of a single, adult male homeless due to poor choices, disability, addiction and mental
illness is the default of popular belief. This image has become the “visible” face of homelessness
in the eyes of U.S. (Medcalf, 2008). Societal perceptions of homeless rarely include families and
children. However, current demographic accounts of U.S. homeless increasingly involve single
mothers with young children, and include the working poor.

9

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Within the last 30 years the United States has witnessed two “surges” in the incidence of family
homelessness; one occurring in the 1980’s, the second beginning in 2007 (Masten, 2012;
Medcalf, 2008; Oberg, 2011). Repercussions from the 2007 economic crisis, also referred to as
the “Great Recession”, launched the most recent surge in family homelessness—where high
rates of unemployment and underemployment, a housing market crisis, and decreases in supports
of social safety networks prevailed (Masten, 2012; Oberg, 2011). As a result of the national
economic downturn, coupled with existing racial and ethnic disparities, homelessness has
become a reality for more than one million children in the United States each year (National
Center on Family Homelessness, 2010).
Family homelessness has been described as an indicator of extreme poverty and is a risk
factor for healthy growth and academic outcomes (Masten, 1993). Stress and adversity
associated with homelessness severely restricts parents’ ability to access basic necessities and
adequately support children’s cognitive, physical, social and emotional needs (Swick, 2009).
According to findings from Masten, Herbers, Desjardins, Cutuli, McCormick, Sapinza, et al.
(2012) cumulative risk factors associated with poverty and homelessness may include:
residential instability/high mobility; food insecurity; malnutrition; family and community
violence; health issues; loss of parent (i.e., separation, death); and social isolation. Children
residing in homeless shelters often have few opportunities to engage in developmentally
appropriate stimulating play activities (Buckner, 2008; Swick, 2009).
Resources available for play (i.e., appropriate spaces and quality materials, adult
guidance) in shelter settings tend to be limited in variety and level of complexity, and thereby
insufficient in meeting the vast cognitive, social, emotional, and physical needs of young
children. Diminished availability of play resources in the environment, coupled with the stress
10

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
and demands associated with homelessness, make it difficult if not impossible for mothers to
initiate and sustain nurturing, supportive play interactions. It is through positive interactions,
such as those found in nurturing caregiver-child play experiences, where healthy bonding takes
place and becomes strengthened.
Healthy mother-child attachments beginning early in a child’s life facilitate the development of
functionally adaptive skills such as positive sense of self, emotional regulation, and resiliency in
young children (Erikson, 1950; Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012; Swick, 2008). Mother-child
relationships are strengthened during daily interactions in safe, nurturing environments supported
by caring adults. Contexts with few opportunities for quality mother-child play interactions serve
to hinder the development of positive mother-child relationships and bonding—affecting the
trajectory for healthy cognitive, social, emotional and physical growth (Milteer & Ginsburg,
2012).
Through play experiences children begin to build foundational knowledge and practice
skills which facilitate the growth of healthy adaptive functioning (Bodrova and Leong, 1996;
Singer, Golinkoff, and Hisrh-Pasek, 2006). Young children cultivate skills and knowledge of
“collaboration, content, communication, creative innovation, and confidence” through childdirected free-play and adult guided playful learning experiences in rich diverse environments. It
is from skills and knowledge gained during the early childhood period that children develop the
capacity for constructing and utilizing strategies facilitating problem-solving and negotiation of
future academic and social experiences (Bodrova and Leong, 1996; Gonzalez, Moll and Amanti,
2005; Singer, Golinkoff, and Hirsh-Pasek, 2006; Vygotsky, 1978).
This literature review is composed of 3 main sections. Together, they form a comprehensive
view of contemporary family homelessness in the United States. The review includes an
11

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
overview of research based evidence to support why the medium of play matters so much in the
lives of young children experiencing homelessness. The first section of the literature review
provides an overview of family homelessness in the United States. The second section details the
unique characteristics of child homelessness. A description of the concept of play and the
importance of its role in early childhood development is presented in the final section.
Family Homelessness
The United States has encountered a significant increase in the number of young families
with children who are homeless, particularly families of racial and ethnic minority backgrounds
(Child Trends, 2012; Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness, 2011). According to The
National Center on Family Homelessness (2011) there are several common demographic
characteristics shared by families experiencing homelessness today. Families typically include
young, single, female headed households, with limited education and income, and two children;
generally one child is under the age of 6.
Repercussions from the 2007 economic crisis, also referred to as the “Great Recession”,
launched the most recent surge in family homelessness—where high rates of unemployment and
underemployment, a housing market crisis, and decreases in supports of social safety networks
prevailed (Masten, 2012; Oberg, 2011). The national economic downturn, coupled with existing
racial and ethnic disparities, has made homelessness a reality for more than a million children in
the United States each year (National Center on Family Homelessness, 2014). According to
America’s Youngest Outcasts: A Report Card on Child Homelessness, 2014) there were over 2
million children experiencing homelessness in 2013—51% were under the age of 6.

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Unique Characteristics of Child Homelessness
Children experiencing homelessness are part of a distinctly vulnerable group of children
living in poverty (Buckner, 2008; Masten, 1992; Masten, et al., 2012; Oberg, 2011; Swick,
2004). This population of children faces similar economic and social adversities as housed peers
in families of comparable economic status, and therefore faces similar impacts to growth and
development. However homelessness can compound negative influences stemming from
poverty, and often manifests as higher incidences of poorer health, academic, social, and life
outcomes than more stably housed impoverished children (Buckner, 2008). As Oberg (2011)
declared in his commentary article on the status of children during the recession,
“[h]omelessness represents the quintessential state of impoverishment” (p. 554).
In her 1992 review article, Masten declared the United States to be a “nation at risk” due
to the number of children experiencing homelessness. Masten called for collaborative efforts to
investigate the unique and complex needs of child homelessness. Findings from the 2012 Masten
et al. study of executive function (EF) skills indicated “predictive significance” for EF and
academic outcomes of 138 kindergarten and first grade students experiencing homelessness (p.
375). In their report Masten et al., stated children and families experiencing homelessness are by
no means a homogeneous group, rather individual families and children have multiple
overlapping characteristics that form various degrees of cumulative risk factors. The authors
suggested risk factors, such as residential mobility, food insecurity, familial and/or community
violence, and social isolation, act in concert to facilitate or impair children’s EF development
(Masten, et al., 2012). Swick (2004; 2008) discussed impacts of homelessness on parent-child
relationships. Obstacles, associated with the distinctive nature of family homelessness, act as
“psycho-social barriers” to healthy parent-child interactions and nurturing relationships (p.151).

13

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
These barriers undermine parent-child relationships vital to children’s mental health and overall
well-being.
Homelessness and brain development. Research findings suggested young children
who experience homelessness often begin school months behind stably housed peers, and that
this disparity typically increases over time (Buckner, 2008; Masten, 2012; Nunez, 2000;
Obradovic’et al., 2009; Swick, 2005). Young children living in extreme cases of poverty, such as
in situations of homelessness, are most at risk of negative impacts to brain growth and
developmental trajectories (Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012). Adverse effects of poverty on areas of
the brain associated with key academic and life skills such as self-regulation, language, attention,
planning, and problem-solving have been indicated in brain development and deprivation
studies. These risks are related to the expansive amount of brain development that occurs during
the period of early childhood (American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Early Brain and
Child Development, 2014; National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000; National
Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2004; Shonkoff & Garner, 2011). Structural and
functional characteristics of the developing brain are influenced not only by genetics but by
dimensions of the child’s environment. Lack of resources and adversities associated with living
in poverty can impair the developing brain’s capacity to create and maintain strong neural
pathways associated with foundational academic skills (Lipina & Farah, 2011; Tomalski, Moore,
Ribeiro, Axelsson, Murphy, Karmiloff-Smith, Johnson, & Kushnerenko, 2011).
Early brain development is elicited by a child’s active engagement in stimulating
supportive environments. Play environments are composed of two interacting factors, the
physical space and the dynamics of the social relationships within the space. Developmentally
supportive play environments are purposefully created spaces, maintained by caring adults who

14

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
understand the importance of building trusting respectful relationships with children. In
stimulating supportive environments children are able to freely explore, follow their sense of
curiosity, and cultivate skills of imagination and creativity. Supportive environments include
interesting, challenging materials and activities appropriate for the child’s developmental level.
Rich stimulating play environments offer access to affordances that spark children’s imagination
and creativity and evoke critical thinking and problem-solving. The adult’s role in supportive
stimulating play environments is one of facilitator; in other words the adult is available to
interact with and also act to guide interactions and strong emotions of children within the
environment. When access to such environments is limited, neural growth and thus overall brain
development can be negatively affected (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine,
2000).
Findings from research conducted by Hair, Hanson, Wolfe, and Pollak (2013) suggested
that academic and cognitive scores in 4 to 22 year olds were positively related to income. The
researchers indicated that brain structures associated with attention, problem solving, and
memory in children from low-income families were at risk from negative environmental factors.
More specifically, Fantuzzo, LeBoeuf, Brumley, and Perlman (2013) suggested that the timing of
homelessness impacts the degree of effects on later academic skills. In their findings, Fantuzzo et
al. (2013), found poorer academic outcomes in children experiencing homelessness during early
childhood compared to those experiencing homelessness in later childhood. What is important to
understand from research on brain development is that during early childhood, children’s brains
are developing at a rapid rate. The neural connections in a child’s brain govern specific adaptive
functions such as memory, planning, and emotional control and are strengthened or diminished
depending on the child’s interactions with people and stimuli in the environment (National

15

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000). In other words, when a child’s environment
lacks fundamental resources (e.g., space to play freely, stimulating play materials) and supports
(e.g., positive adult guidance to assist in regulating the child’s strong emotions, such as anger
and fear, stemming from stress), neural “wiring” of the brain can be negatively impacted—thus
potentially impairing a child’s developmental trajectory. What research findings indicated is that
a supportive environment is an important factor in a child’s healthy growth and development,
and is particularly crucial to consider for children and families experiencing homelessness.
Imaging data from neuroimaging studies have shown correlations between poverty and
brain development (Lipina & Farah, 2011; Luby, Belden, Botteron, Marrus, Harms, Babb, et al.,
2013; Hair, Hanson, Wolfe, & Pollak, 2013; Noble et al., 2012). In their brief on child poverty
and cognitive neuroscience, Lipina & Farah (2011) cite research pointing to correlations between
environmental deprivation and impacts to the “ongoing developmental process” in early
childhood. Adverse effects of poverty on areas of the brain associated with key academic and life
skills such as self-regulation, language, attention, and problem-solving have been indicated in
brain development and deprivation studies. In a neuroimaging study of the effects of poverty on
neurobiological development, results demonstrated a positive correlation between child poverty
and smaller brain volumes in white and grey brain matter as well as hippocampal and amygdala
areas (Luby et al., 2013). These brain regions are associated with language and self-regulation
ability (Dinez Can, Richards, & Kuhl, 2013; Lipinia & Farah, 2011; Luby et al., 2013). Study
findings from Hair, et al., (2013) and Noble et al., (2012) indicated a positive association
between children living in poverty and smaller hippocampal size. These research findings point
to correlations in the structural differences of the brains of children living in poverty and the
brains of their middle and upper class peers. This has direct implications for children living in

16

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
situations of deprivation and homelessness and calls for the need to study the contextual nature
of homeless shelters serving young children and families.
To summarize, children living in situations of poverty and deprivation, such as in
episodes of homelessness, face negative impacts to overall development. Factors—such as
diminished access to supportive stimulating environments for play—associated with early child
homelessness may alter developmental trajectories through impairments to neural pathways
associated with learning, emotion regulation, and mental health. When fundamental resources
and adult supports for healthy play are absent in the child’s environment, structural and
functional characteristics of the brain can be impaired, hence affecting overall development and
life outcomes.
Homelessness and repercussions to child mental health. The foundations of mental
health are formed in the early years of life. Nurturing environments and secure parent-child
attachment are critical to early mental well-being. Emotional and cognitive demands associated
with trauma and stress act to decrease parents’ capacity to support children’s healthy growth and
development, particularly the development of social-emotional skills (Bassuk, Richard, and
Tsertsvadze, 2015; Masten, 1993; Masten, Herbers, Desjardins, Cutuli, McCormick, Sapenza,
Long, & Zelazo 2012).
A study conducted by Bassuk, Richard, and Tsertsvadze (2015) looked across findings
from multiple investigations with children experiencing homelessness. Bassuk et al., (2015)
conducted a meta-analysis of mental health issues and child homelessness. The study analyzed
12 separate investigations to determine prevalence of mental health issues in homeless children
in the United States in an effort to inform intervention policy and practice. Findings indicated

17

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
mental health and behavioral issues were more prevalent in preschool and school-age children
experiencing homelessness than in stably-housed peers.
Masten (1993) offered explanations of homelessness’ adverse relationship with
psychosocial health. In her 1993 study, Masten discussed correlations between early childhood
homelessness and mental health issues. Findings from the study indicated that homeless children
were more likely to experience problem behavior issues than stably housed peers in families of
similar income. Behavioral issues were also found to be associated with poorer academic
outcomes in children experiencing poverty and homelessness (Masten, Herbers, Desjardins,
Cutuli, McCormick, Sapenza, Long, & Zelazo 2012). Research findings point to the increased
propensity for children who were formerly homeless to present with more psychosocial issues
when compared to stably housed peers of matched socioeconomic status. Study findings from
Gewirtz, Hart-Shego, and Medhanie (2008) indicated a significant relationship between parent
mental health and child behavior and emotional status. Gewritz et al. (2008) also reported
findings suggesting an increase in number of risk exposures predicted amount of reported
psychosocial concerns while controlling for child’s age. Beyond brain development and mental
health, aspects of poor physical health from lack of access to quality healthcare and nutrition are
other factors mediating overall health and development of children experiencing homelessness.
Physical health outcomes and homelessness. Physical health is generally poorer in
homeless children than in their stably housed peers. Children who are homeless tend to have
limited medical and dental care access, exhibit behavioral related issues, and experience food
insecurity more frequently than housed peers (see McCoy-Roth, Murphey, and Mackintosh,
2012). Children and families experiencing homelessness have an increased incidence of risk
factors leading to higher susceptibility to chronic diseases such as asthma, and various

18

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
psychosocial disorders. Asthma is significantly more prevalent in homeless children than stably
domiciled children (Cutuli, Herbers, Rinaldi, Masten, and Oberg, 2010). Cutuli, et al. (2010),
examined the relationship between asthma and adaptive skills in young children at a residential
homeless shelter. Findings indicated that for children in this study, asthma was significantly
associated with more poorly managed and more severe forms of asthma, higher frequency of
visits to emergency departments, higher rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity issues (ADHD),
and poorer academic outcomes, than rates of children from higher socioeconomic status.
Food insecurity and hunger. Other risk factors faced by homeless families include food
insecurity and hunger (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2011). The top three leading causes
of hunger, reported by the US Mayors Report from the Hunger and Homeless 2009 Survey, were
unemployment, high costs of housing, and low wages (US Conference of Mayors 2009 Status
Report on Hunger and Homelessness, p.5). The absence of consistent access to adequate amounts
of nutritional sources of food often leads to poor nutrition, food insecurity, and hunger, and is a
common occurrence in poor and homeless families with children (Gundersen, Weinreb, Wehler,
and Hosmer, 2003; Ma, Gee, and Kushel, 2008; Nord and Parker, 2010; Weinreb, Wehler,
Peloff, Scott, Hosmer, Sagor, et al., 2002). Factors related to food insecurity have been
associated with poor health, cognitive, and social and emotional functioning in young children
(Skalicky, Meyers, Adams, Yang, Cook, and Frank, 2006; Slopen, Fitzmaurice, Williams, and
Gilman, 2010).
In summary, early childhood is a period of intense formative growth and development.
For children living in situations of extreme poverty, such as homelessness, developmental
trajectories are often derailed by adversities associated with deprivation. This derailment
tragically may leave them ill-equipped to adaptively function cognitively, emotionally, socially,

19

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
and physically, thus negatively affecting later life outcomes. Findings from focused research of
the dynamic and contextual nature of young children’s play in homeless shelters can shed light
on factors working to facilitate or diminish healthy play experiences. Play interactions with a
nurturing caregiver in a stimulating environment can act as a protective mechanism for risks to
neural development, psychological, and physical health associated with early life homelessness.
Play
Play serves a vital role in early childhood development (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002;
Brown & Webb, 2005; Erikson, 1950; Piaget, 1962; Vygotsky, 1978). Play during early
childhood is the primary medium through which learning occurs, and serves as a protective
mechanism for children facing cumulative risk factors, such as those linked with homelessness
(Fearn & Howard, 2012; Kraus, 2006; Masten, Miliotis, Graham-Bermann, Ramirez, & Neeman,
1993). Peak opportunities for learning in early childhood occur during supportive stimulating
play experiences (Gray, 2011; Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012). Research findings demonstrated that
young children develop skills associated with future academic and life success during play
(Bodrova & Leong, 1996; Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012; Singer, Golinkoff, & Hisrh-Pasek, 2006;
Vygotsky, 1978). In a discussion on learning and play, Bodrova and Leong (1996) indicated that
the absence of stimulating supportive play experiences denies children opportunities to learn and
practice valuable life skills, including self-regulation and creative problem-solving—important to
academic outcomes and overall well-being.
Socio-cultural learning theory and play. Looking through the lens of Vygotsky’s social
learning theory (1978)—which states that children learn through play interactions in their
cultural and social environments—play takes on a critical role in understanding the implications
of early childhood homelessness. Limited opportunities for play experiences deprive children of

20

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
the potential to gain new knowledge and build fundamental skills, including: problem-solving,
self-regulation, appropriate risk taking, and divergent thinking; and a sense of mastery,
competence, confidence, and resiliency (Brown, 2005; Fearn and Howard, 2012; Garvey, 1977;
Milteer, Ginsburg, and Mulligan, 2011; Paley, 2004). Volatile economic resources (i. e., public
and private funding sources) and the distinct structural (e.g., space limitations) and functional
(e.g., rules, routines, schedules) characteristics of homeless shelters, coupled with unique family
characteristics can act in concert to either hinder or facilitate healthy play (Buckner, 2008;
Harms, 1998; Masten, Miliotis, Graham-Bermann, Ramirez, & Neemann 1993; Perlman, Cowan,
Gewirtz, Haskett, and Stokes, 2012; Swick, 2004, 2009).
Research findings demonstrated that young children develop skills associated with future
academic and life success during play (Bodrova & Leong, 1996; Milteer & Ginsburg, 2012;
Singer, Golinkoff, & Hisrh-Pasek, 2006; Vygotsky, 1978). In a discussion on learning and play,
Bodrova and Leong (1996) indicated that the absence of stimulating supportive play experiences
denies children opportunities to learn and practice valuable life skills, including self-regulation
and creative problem-solving which play an important role in academic outcomes.
Young children need opportunities to practice turn-taking, sharing, and conflict resolution
through interactions with peers during guided play experiences in stimulating supportive
environments (Zero to Three, 2014). Play not only serves as the primary medium for early
learning, and building self-regulatory and problem-solving skills, but also acts as a protective
factor mediating early adversity.
Protective nature of play. Research findings also pointed to the protective nature of play
in the lives of young children living in adverse circumstances (Brown, 2005; Erikson, 1950;
Fearn & Howard, 2012; Masten, 2011). According to Erikson (1950), play is a mechanism used

21

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
to sort through and deal with life events. Through play children learn to resolve real-world
problems. Researchers suggested that play, meaning the active engagement in play in stimulating
environments, coupled with support from caring adults, has the potential to assist children in
coming to terms with daily life encounters (Brown, 2005; Chawla, Keena, Pevic, & Stanley,
2014; Fearn & Howard, 2012). Learning strategies for coping with challenging and stressful
situations is a major skill children endeavor to acquire and hone in the early years, and is
particularly salient for children experiencing homelessness.
Resiliency. There is a long research history of correlations between child development,
adversity and resilience. In her study of child development, resiliency and homelessness, Masten
(2001) maintained that involvement in caring adult-child relationships, possession of selfregulatory skills and a sense of competence and positive self-identity contribute to the
development of emotional resiliency during childhood, particularly for children living in adverse
situations such as homelessness. Research findings suggested that during play children are
capable of building the skills underlying the development of emotional resiliency (Berk &
Meyers, 2013; Brown & Webb, 2005; Cohen, Pat-Horenczyk, & Haar-Shamir, 2014; Fern &
Howard, 2012). Berk and Meyers (2013) contend that executive function skills develop in
contexts supportive of children’s imaginative play experiences. Findings from Brown and
Webb’s research on Romanian orphans suggested that during play in safe supportive
environments, children engaged in the vital processes of healing from severe deprivation (Brown
& Webb, 2005). Cohen, Pat-Horenczyk, and Haar-Shamir (2014) discussed the connection
between play and children’s ability to adaptively cope under the life threatening circumstances of
war. Fern and Howard (2012) suggested play was a mediating factor in the negative impacts of
living in extreme contexts of civil war, and abandonment. Sutton-Smith (2004) indicated that

22

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
children develop courage through imaginative play episodes. The prominent play researchers
claimed that it is through dramatic play experiences that children have opportunities to deal with
stressful events found in their environments, thus bolstering feelings of competence, positive
self-identity and courage (Sutton-Smith, 2004).
In summary, the role of play as a primary medium for early growth and development is
well established in the literature. Early neurological, cognitive, social and emotional
development in homeless children may be affected by diminished opportunities to engage in
healthy play activities. To mitigate impacts stemming from deprivation and stress, young
children experiencing homelessness can benefit from opportunities to engage in stimulating
supportive play interactions with nurturing caregivers. Research of children’s play experiences in
homeless shelters is relatively non-existent. Based on the premise mentioned previously,
qualitative exploratory research is a prudent first step to take in filling the void in the literature.
Rigorously designed studies of young children’s play in homeless shelters have the potential to
contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the ecological characteristics and associated
effects on early growth and development. Implications from findings may be utilized as a
catalyst to improve services and outcomes for young children and families experiencing
homelessness.
Chapter 3
Research Design and Methodology
To cultivate a rich description of the contextual nature of play in the lives of women and
children experiencing homelessness, six mothers from one shelter were interviewed individually
and three of the six mothers were interviewed as a group during a single photo elicitation
interview session. Multiple sources of data were utilized to inform, clarify, and also corroborate

23

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
with data collected during interviews with mothers. Evidence sources included: extensive field
notes and audio-visual documentation of the geographic space and social interactions collected
during observations; and interviews with three staff and two volunteers from the research site.
Findings were based on evidence gathered to answer the research question, How is play
perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of a residential shelter for
women and children?
Introduction
The purpose of this research was to explore and extend understanding of the phenomenon
of young children’s play in the context of a homeless shelter. This exploratory single case study
was situated within a qualitative approach. Qualitative researchers are keenly interested in
“insight, discovery, and interpretation” of particular phenomena (Merriam, 1998, p. 28); and
seek to gather personally constructed meanings of lived experiences occurring in natural
environments (Creswell, 2013). Differing from the quantitative research approach, the
interpretative constructivist framework of qualitative research is well suited for developing a
more holistic understanding of complex social issues. This study employed qualitative research
methods to collect, analyze, and interpret mothers’ perceptions of the nature of play in a
homeless shelter, thus building a descriptive narrative of a complex social issue—play in the
lives of families and young children experiencing homelessness.
In an effort to more fully understand play as it occurred in a homeless shelter, this
investigation relied on procedures found in case study design. Case study research findings
contribute specific details, rich descriptions, and in-depth knowledge of a particular phenomenon
within a bounded setting (Creswell 2013; Yin, 2009). This chapter details the rationale for the
study approach, and describes the setting, research design, and methods in relation to this study.

24

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Case Study Research Design
According to Yin (2009), empirical research designs follow a logical order to answer
research questions based on observable, experimental, or experiential data. Research designs are
theoretically conceived guides for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting empirical data about a
phenomenon of interest. For this research, an exploratory single case study design was used to
garner mothers’ perceptions of children’s play in a homeless shelter.
Exploratory single case study design is well suited for collecting specific information
pertaining to a phenomenon situated in a particular setting (Merriam, 1998; Yin, 2009).. Based
on the intent of this study, exploratory single case study design was the appropriate
methodological approach. Opportunities for supportive play may be facilitated or constrained by
factors inherent in shelter settings. Interpretations of the constructed meanings mothers assign to
the daily realities of homelessness can serve to shed light on specific factors within the shelter
that work to support or restrict a child’s healthy growth and early development. Findings from an
exploratory case study can be employed to inform future research endeavors, policies, and
practices seeking to improve service delivery and outcomes for mothers and children
experiencing homelessness.
Case study research focuses on real life issues bounded by time or setting within a
contemporary context (Creswell, 2013; Yin, 2009). For this study the bounded case was defined
as a residential shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness; the unit of analysis
was mothers’ perceptions of children’s play in a homeless shelter. Case study methodology is
grounded in social constructivist theory (Creswell, 2013; Yin, 2009). The methodology is
concerned with experiences occurring in socially situated contexts, and thus aligns with the
constructivist worldview embraced by this researcher. Case study methodology is a particularly

25

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
salient approach to use when boundaries between phenomenon and setting are not readily
discernible, and the issue of interest is complex, multifaceted, and intertwined with a broad range
of contextually relevant factors (Creswell, 2013; Merriam, 1998; Yin, 2009). The nature of play
in homeless shelters is a social phenomenon influenced by dynamic variables inherent in the
make-up of each shelter. Mothers’ perceptions of play are influenced by factors unique to
individual shelter characteristics. To gain a deep understanding of the nature of children’s play as
it is experienced in a homeless shelter, this researcher chose to study the perceptions of mothers’
residing at one urban shelter serving women and children.
Case study is employed to answer ‘how’ or ‘why’ questions, and typically utilized in
three situations: (1) studies of a descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory nature, (2) studies
seeking a deep understanding of phenomena in its natural setting, and (3) in studies of an
evaluative nature (Yin, 2009). For this research, an exploratory single case study design was
used to garner mothers’ perceptions of children’s play in a homeless shelter.
Exploratory single case study. Multiple data sources provided a means of building
depth to the case narrative, creating verisimilitude, and corroborating findings (Creswell, 2013;
Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014; Yin, 2009); or as Guba (1981) asserted, the trustworthiness
of a naturalistic inquiry.
This study is exploratory in nature due to the lack of information in the literature
regarding the phenomenon of children’s play in homeless shelters. Prior research findings
indicated the need for further study of ecological factors associated with child homelessness
(Buckner, 2008; Harms, 1998; Swick, 2008). A thorough review of the literature revealed a
dearth of empirical studies pertaining to child homelessness and play, as well as a paucity of
literature specifically focused on young children’s play in the context of homeless shelters.

26

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Therefore, based on the intent of this study, an exploratory single case study design was used to
answer the following research question:
How is play perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of a residential
homeless shelter for women and children?
Research Site
Context. As defined by the researcher, the bounded case was a residential shelter serving
women and children experiencing homelessness. The research site was an emergency homeless
shelter in an urban Midwestern community. The shelter is part of a well-established organization
of homeless shelters incorporated in 1984. The research site was a spacious four story renovated
home located in an urban residential neighborhood. Video surveillance cameras were placed at
each entry point. Access to the shelter was via one main door which was monitored and
controlled by shelter staff. Common spaces were primarily located on the first floor and
basement. Bedrooms were located on the second and third floors. Administrative offices were
also located on the second floor.
The playroom, craft room, laundry, storage, and a half bath were located in the basement.
On the main floor of the home was the kitchenette for families, full kitchen where volunteers
prepared the evening meals, a dining room with capacity for approximately twenty-five adults
and children, a meeting room where life skills classes were held for parents four nights per week,
living room, and half bath. Two separate stairways provided access to the second floor. The
second floor housed the four staff and administrative offices, several larger bedrooms created to
accommodate mothers with multiple school age children, and a full bathroom with the only bath
tub in the home. One narrow stairway offered access to the third floor where smaller bedrooms
and a full bath with two showers were located. The bedrooms on the third floor were designed

27

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
for mothers with young children. The shelter was created through the efforts of local women to
meet existing needs for housing and shelter and was one of four facilities owned and operated by
the organization. Over the course of more than 30 years the shelter has provided temporary
emergency housing for thousands of local families. In January of 2015, the shelter acquired three
additional emergency shelters located throughout the urban core.
Site selection. The aim of the study was to garner rich descriptive narratives of the nature
of children’s play as perceived by mothers residing in a shelter for women and children
experiencing homelessness. The characteristics of urban homeless shelters and the population
served by homeless shelters vary. Shelters provide services for individuals based on individual
characteristics and needs (e.g., domestic violence survivor, substance abuse treatment, women
with children, families with adult males, single adults, and unaccompanied youth). To gather rich
detailed descriptions of the contextual nature of young children’s play in a residential homeless
shelter, this study was conducted at one site. The site selected was an urban emergency shelter
for mothers and their children experiencing homelessness.
Selection of the research site was based on 2 factors: (1). The demographics of the
population served at the site—mothers with young children experiencing homelessness, and (2).
The researcher had developed rapport with the shelter director and several staff members prior to
the study, thus gaining entry to the research site. After receiving Non-Human Subject Research
Designation from the university’s Institutional Review Board (Appendix A), the researcher
requested permission from the shelter director to conduct research at the site. The shelter director
signed a letter of site support giving the researcher permission to conduct the study at the shelter
(Appendix B).

28

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Participants
Context. Increasing numbers of families experiencing homelessness are under-resourced
single mothers, with one or more children less than 6 years of age (Institute for Children, Poverty
and Homelessness, 2013). Given that women with young children constitute an ever-growing
segment of the homeless population, and that parent-child bonding and early formation of
fundamental life skills occur during the early childhood period, Swick (2010) recommended that
researchers should seek out the voices of homeless mothers and their children. The author
reasoned that mothers offered critical insight to the needs of young children experiencing
homelessness. Therefore this researcher deemed an exploratory case study focused on mothers’
perceptions of young children’s play to be both timely and warranted.
This study took place in an emergency homeless shelter located in an urban Midwestern
community. Criterion for participants included, adult mothers with their children under the age
of 6 years, who were residing in the shelter at the time of the study. Participants were six adult
mothers (18 years of age or above) and their seven children. Informants consisted of three adult
shelter staff and two adult volunteers (18 years of age or older). Informants were selected based
on their knowledge of the mission, history, and daily routines of the shelter. The shelter director
indicated which informants would be most suitable for providing the researcher with orienting
information.
Mothers were recruited for this study based on three primary factors detailed in the
previous chapter. As stated earlier, a child’s long-term trajectory of educational and life success
is negatively impacted by early life adversity (Shonkoff & Garner, 2011). Secondly, adversity
and stress associated with poverty is compounded by deprivations stemming from homelessness
(Buckner, 2008; Swick, 2008). And finally but most importantly, mothers are the experts on their

29

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
child and thus understand most intimately the impacts of homelessness on young children
(Brazelton & Sparrow, 2003; Swick, 2010). Therefore, to shed light on the nature of play—a
mechanism for cognitive development, healthy growth and learning, and a vehicle for
ameliorating effects of trauma—in the lives of families and young children experiencing
homelessness, this researcher chose to recruit mothers with children under the age of 6 for this
study.
Presentation of Descriptive Characteristics
Introduction. The participants of this study were six mothers ranging in age from 23 to
38 years old, and their seven children ranging in age from 5 months to 4 years old. Four mothers
self-categorized as African American, one mother self-categorized as Bi-Racial, and one mother
self-categorized as Multi-Racial. Participants resided at the research site, an urban core
emergency shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness, during the summer
months of 2015.
One interview was conducted individually with each of the six participating mothers. A
second follow-up interview was conducted with two of the mothers to obtain clarifying
information. In July, two of the participating mothers exited the shelter with their children to
unknown locations (i.e., the two mothers left the shelter with their children and did not return);
neither provided contact information. By mid-September 2015 three mothers had moved into
transitional housing and one mother had transferred into a long-term shelter program. The shelter
director reported that the average length of stay for families at the shelter was 30 days. The
length of shelter stay for the six mothers participating in this study ranged from 58-93 days, with
an average stay of 75 days. Demographic information for mothers is summarized in Table1
below.

Recruitment. Recruitment of participants was initiated after the researcher met with the
shelter director to review the research protocol and confirm permission for conducting the
research. Data collection began April 2015 and ended September of 2015. Recruitment of
participants took place during an information session with all the mothers, organized by an
evening staff member, and was held in a conference room located on the main floor of the
shelter. A recruitment flyer (Appendix C) was made available to mothers during the
informational session. The researcher introduced herself and the nature of the study. Three
31

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
mothers meeting the selection criteria were interested in participating in the study and were
scheduled to discuss the research in more detail at a time and place of their choice.
Recruitment efforts beyond the informational meeting continued via word-of-mouth, and
took place in common areas of the shelter such as the dining room or lobby. Three mothers
entering the shelter two weeks into the research period were recruited and agreed to participate.
Informants (staff and volunteers) were recruited over a period of the first six weeks of the study
due to the irregularities of volunteers’ schedules during the summer months, and the nature of
staff working various shifts. Saturation was chosen as the criterion for terminating recruitment of
participants.
Sampling. Purposeful sampling method was used to select a research site with
participants potentially the most “information rich” with regard to the phenomenon and intent of
the study (Creswell, 2013; Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña, 2014; Patton, 1990; Yin, 2009).
Purposeful selection of participants was employed to accrue an in-depth understanding of the
phenomena of young children’s play as it was experienced and perceived by mothers residing in
a homeless shelter.
After a review of the study purpose, discussion questions, and contact information for the
researcher, researcher’s advisor, and the Institutional Review Board, participants agreeing to
participate in the study signed an informed consent form (Appendix D) and were given a copy of
the consent document. Unique identifiers were assigned to each participant to protect privacy and
insure anonymity. Only participants giving signed permission were audio recorded and/or
visually documented. Participants were informed that participation in the study was strictly
voluntary and that they may stop participating at any time.

32

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
The specific methods used to gather and analyze data for the study will be presented in
the following section of this chapter. Methods will be discussed in terms of why they were
chosen and how each assisted in answering the research question.
Data Collection
Data collection included semi-structured interviews, observations and field notes, audio
and video recording, and photo elicitation methods (Harper, 2002). In this study specific data
sources were employed to collect constructed meanings of play in order to build an accurate
description of the phenomenon within the context of the shelter. Mothers were the primary
source of data; shelter staff and volunteers served as key informants. The researcher served as the
data collection instrument (Creswell, 2014; Hatch, 2002). The primary method of data collection
for this study was interview. Interview is considered one of the most important tools for
collecting case study data (Rubin and Rubin, 2012; Yin, 2009). Observations, field notes, photo
elicitation interview, and audio-visual documentation were utilized for clarification and
corroboratory purposes (Harper, 2002; Yin, 2009).
Interviews. There often exists an uneven hierarchy of power between researcher and
study participants (Creswell, 2014; Rubin & Rubin, 2012). To address this issue, researchers
must incorporate study methods capable of mitigating power hierarchies. Thus, an interview
method based on an informal discussion format is well suited for studies situated in an
environment of unequal structures of power.
The use of a semi-structured interview process was selected for the informal
conversational style inherent in the process (Rubin and Rubin, 2012). According to Rubin and
Rubin (2012), personal descriptions of social phenomenon gathered via a semi-structured
interview approach allow for first-hand accounts and original themes to emerge while

33

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
concurrently maintaining a sense of direction to the flow of the conversation. Semi-structured
interviews consisted of scheduled individual meetings between the researcher and each of the six
mothers, and the researcher and the five key informants, which included three shelter staff and
two volunteers. The conversational nature of this interview method assisted in diminishing the
power hierarchy between the researcher and participants.
After reviewing the study details with each participant and key informant individually,
and obtaining signed consent, semi-structured interviews were scheduled and conducted. One
strategy for obtaining multiple points of view regarding play in the homeless shelter was to
interview mothers residing at the shelter and also to include the ascribed perspectives of
informants. This case study relied on multiple sources of evidence to produce a balanced
understanding of the phenomenon. Interviews were conducted with participating mothers to elicit
personal perspectives of the general concept of play, past play experiences, and participants’
perceptions of the nature of play in the context of the homeless shelter. Interviews were
conducted with five key informants to obtain a more balanced understanding of the range of
constructed perceptions of play at the shelter and to corroborate with data. Key informants also
offered specific information regarding the daily routine, and the history and mission of the
shelter.
Based on the merits described above, semi-structured interview was selected for this
study. The researcher employed an interview guide containing open-ended questions, probes and
prompts designed to elicit discussion regarding participants’ perceptions of play (Appendix E).
Open-ended questions and prompts for mothers included: Tell me about play during your
childhood; and, Tell me about children’s play here [at the shelter]. Interview questions and

34

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
prompts for staff and volunteers included: What is the daily schedule like for you? For families?
and, What can you tell me about children’s play here [at the shelter]?
Photo elicitation. Loosely defined, photo elicitation is a visual research method designed
to use images to foster descriptive discussions. Harper (2002) suggested that interviews
combined with visual images stimulate more emotive responses than interviews employing only
text; that, “…images evoke deeper elements of human consciousness than do words…” (p. 13).
Methods such as photo elicitation have been utilized in prior research to evoke descriptive indepth discussions of unspoken and invisible social realities of marginalized individuals (Clark,
2010; Harper, 2002; Orellana, 1999; Wang, Cash, and Powers, 2000). Photo elicitation is
generally used concurrently with research interview methods—allowing for a creative sensitive
process of gathering unique perspectives of study participants within a social context (Harper,
2002). Photo-elicitation interview was used in this study to elicit qualitatively unique
information inaccessible by traditional methods. This method enabled the researcher a means of
delving deeper into the essence of mothers’ understandings of the nature of play, than when
using interview methods alone.
Photo elicitation interview was conducted at the shelter with three of the six mothers
participating in the study. A photo elicitation packet (Appendix F) was created by the researcher
for the photo elicitation interview process. Photo elicitation packets were composed of nine color
photographs depicting areas in or around the shelter playroom and playground. The researcher
prepared identical packets for each of the three mothers. Photographs were selected based on
potential to evoke enhanced discussions related to particular themes that had emerged from the
interview and observational data. The mothers selected the time and location for the photo
elicitation interview. The 45 minute interview took place at the shelter on the deck outside while

35

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
the children played on the playground or stayed on the deck in close proximity to their mothers.
During the photo-elicitation interview mothers discussed and shared their feelings, thoughts, and
beliefs about daily life at the shelter. The photo-elicitation interview provided a vehicle for
mothers to reflect on and share their understanding of the opportunities and barriers related to
children’s play experiences at the shelter.
Photographs. The researcher took photographs of children playing in the shelter
playroom and on the playground. Photographs were taken only of children whose mothers had
given written permission indicated on the study consent form. Photos of the physical space and
materials of the playroom and physical characteristics of the playground space and equipment
(no children or adults) were also collected. Photographs served three main purposes: (1) to
supplement and clarify interview data, and field notes gathered during observations of social
interactions, (2) to utilize during the photo elicitation interview, and (3) to include in a photo
album for each mother participating in the study. Photographs were not coded or included in data
analysis.
Photographs for clarification of field notes. Photographs provided the researcher with
detailed visual records of the shelter setting and social interactions. Visual data were used to
supplement and clarify interview data, and also field notes recorded during observations.
Photograph album. The researcher provided each mother participating in the study with
a photo album of their child. The album was offered as a form of reciprocity (Creswell, 2014); as
a gesture of appreciation for the time mothers invested in the study. Only children whose
mothers had given signed permission were photographed. The photographs were taken while
children were playing in the playroom or on the playground at the shelter. The researcher met
with each mother individually to review photos and make selections for the album. Each mother

36

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
selected up to 12 photographs to include in their photo album. The photo album also provided a
means for mothers to reflect on and discuss thoughts about their child and daily experiences at
the shelter. In essence the photo albums served as an impromptu photo elicitation interview tool
(Clark-Ibáñez, 2004; Harper, 2002).
Observations and Field Notes. Adler and Adler (1994) described observation as a
research method that, “…consists of gathering impressions of the surrounding world through all
relevant human faculties” (p. 378). Field notes collected during observations consisted of
descriptive narratives of the geography of the space, and the tone of the social interactions
observed during the evening routines. Prior to scheduling interviews, the researcher conducted
two one hour naturalistic observation sessions. These initial observations were documented in
field notes and used to orient the researcher to the flow of daily routines and to build rapport with
families and children. Nine sessions of observations with field notes describing the nature of the
physical spaces and social interactions were conducted using an observation guide created by the
researcher (Appendix G). Observations and field notes were collected between the hours of 5:30
pm and 8:30 pm. Families had a curfew of 5:30 pm Monday through Thursday to insure
attendance at the 6:00 pm meal and the mandatory 7:00pm life skills class. Observed evening
activities included: free time in the lobby, evening meal in the dining room, after-dinner chores,
and play in the playroom or playground.
Audio-visual documentation. To assist in clarifying field notes collected during
observations of children’s play, audio-visual recordings were gathered. The length of audiovisual recording was approximately 15 minutes for each of five sessions conducted over a period
of five weeks. Only children with signed parent permission were recorded. Audio-visual
recordings were not transcribed and were utilized only for clarification purposes during analysis.

37

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Data Analysis
The quality of data analysis begins with a well-thought out analytic strategy. Establishing
a general framework for analysis during this exploratory single case study design provided
direction to the analysis process—what was to be analyzed and why. Making use of an analytic
strategy can aid the researcher in address conflicting interpretations; treating the data in a fair
and concise manner; and developing logically reasoned conclusions (Yin, 2009).
The unit of analysis for this research study was mothers’ perceptions of play in a shelter
for women and children experiencing homelessness. To gain new insight into the phenomena of
play as it was experienced in the homeless shelter and in keeping with the emergent nature of
qualitative inquiry, data collection and analysis were ongoing throughout the study (Creswell,
2013; Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña, 2014; Yin, 2009). Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014)
offered various methods for analyzing data that have been implemented and refined over several
decades of qualitative research. Their recommendations for employing two cycles of coding
were followed in this study. The two cycle method was selected based on the capacity to winnow
down large amounts of raw data gathered from multiple data sources; thereby revealing codes
and patterns which are then more easily organized into categories and overarching themes
(Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014).
The researcher manually organized and summarized the raw data from interview
transcriptions by highlighting salient direct quotes and paraphrases related to the topic of inquiry.
There are three major components to qualitative data analysis: (1) condensation of data, (2)
display of data, and (3) conclusion and verification of findings. An inductive coding process was
used to condense semi-structured interview and photo elicitation interview transcription data into
salient chunks of meaningful material. The inductive coding process ensured codes were

38

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
grounded in the data collected; meaning, the researcher was open to information emerging from
the research site rather than utilizing a priori codes stemming from the literature (Miles,
Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014). Interview data were analyzed manually. Data display matrices
were used to organize the salient chunks of raw data, garnered from the photo elicitation
interview and the semi-structured interviews with mothers, into a succinct visual form of codes
and brief narrative depicting the essence of the data collected. Two data display matrices were
created by the researcher; one containing initial codes and another to depict themes derived from
the second coding cycle. The data display matrices also aided the researcher in the process of
efficiently and effectively drawing conclusions and verifying study findings.
Coding for this study was conducted independently by the primary researcher and a
university faculty member from the nursing department. A third reviewer, a university faculty
member from the early childhood education and human development department, explored
coding analysis for alignment of codes. Coding was conducted by the researcher and faculty
member by hand. The first coding cycle was conducted by the primary researcher. The
researcher manually organized and summarized the raw data from interview transcriptions by
highlighting salient direct quotes and paraphrases related to the topic of inquiry. The second
cycle of coding was conducted manually by the researcher and university nursing department
faculty member. During the second cycle of coding, first cycle summaries were analyzed—
allowing distinctive patterns to rise from the data. Patterns were then organized and analyzed by
categorizing them into overarching themes and subthemes (Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014).

39

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Member checking. Member checking was completed by conducting one photo
elicitation group interview and also by conducting two separate follow-up semi-structured
interviews with participating mothers. Semi-structured interviews with three shelter staff and two
childcare volunteers were conducted to gather corroboratory data. Observation and field note
data were gathered to document the social dynamics and contextual aspects inherent in the daily
routine of the shelter.
Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness defined by Lincoln and Guba (1985), refers to aspects of credibility,
transferability, dependability, and confirmability established in the research study. By adhering
to particular techniques, researchers can address issues commonly associated with
trustworthiness. Triangulation, audit trails, member checking, reflexivity, and prolonged
engagement are examples of the varied techniques suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1985) for
creating trustworthiness of qualitative studies.
Triangulation of data is used as a method for corroborating findings and ensuring
comprehensiveness of the case. The use of multiple sources of data enables the researcher to
produce a balanced detailed narrative of the case. As Yin (2009) explained, the strength behind
case study design rests in “the opportunity to use many different sources of evidence” (p. 115).
Collecting evidence from multiple perspectives via a variety of data collection methods is one
strategy for establishing trustworthiness. In this study the researcher gathered information from 6
mothers and five key informants utilizing methods of interview, photo elicitation, and
observation.
An audit trail is another technique used to create trustworthiness. Audit trails are accounts
of the research process including records of data sources and data collection methods. This study

40

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
followed recommendations from Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, (2014) for management of
research data by creating a data accounting log (Appendix H) to verify research steps taken
throughout the research process.
Member checking is a method used to address trustworthiness of the research. To ensure
credibility of data findings this researcher met with participants to conduct member checking.
The researcher met separately with two of the six mothers included in the study to review
findings. Of the six mothers in the case study, two provided the researcher with contact
information prior to leaving the shelter. Thus member checking was conducted with the two
remaining participants. Member checking also included a third reviewer. A study advisor not
involved in the coding process acted as an independent third reviewer to assess for alignment of
codes and themes. No discrepancies were reported during the member checking process.
It should be noted findings from this study were not intended to be generalizable, but
pertained to the unique contexts of the homeless shelter examined. However, it is feasible that
findings and implications may have transferability (Creswell, 2013; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Yin,
2009). In other words, findings from this investigation may have transferability in the sense that
the information could serve to inform the policies and practices of homeless shelters serving
families with young children.
The researcher must bracket the funds of knowledge they bring to the research process
(Hatch, 2002). The assumptions and biases possessed by the researcher must be acknowledged
and reflected upon throughout the research process to assist in establishing trustworthiness. This
entails the researcher understand how they are situated within the research and to approach the
study with a sense of neutrality (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).The researcher engaged in the practice

41

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
of reflexivity by journaling about personal beliefs, assumptions, and perspectives relating to the
case. Journaling was a separate process from field note documentations.
Prolonged engagement is yet another technique referenced by Lincoln and Guba (1985)
for addressing issues of trustworthiness. The researcher designed the study so that recruitment
would be terminated when data collection reached saturation. This criterion was established at
the design phase of the study to ensure enough time was given to cultivate a detailed narrative of
the mothers’ perceptions of play in the context of the shelter.
Researcher Positionality
In qualitative studies the researcher is the primary instrument for data collection and
analysis. Given this role, it is the responsibility of the researcher to acknowledge and reflect on
personal positionality. How the researcher designs and conducts a study is influenced by existing
socially constructed knowledge, or preconceptions (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The researcher, by
acknowledging the influence of background and position on the study situation, is able to bracket
preconceptions prior to and during the research investigation (Creswell, 2009; Hatch, 2002; Yin,
2009). In this exploratory single case study the researcher was the main instrument for data
collection and analysis, thereby necessitating reflexivity and bracketing of preconceived cultural,
social, and ideological assumptions.
This researcher acknowledged a Euro-American middle class social position. The
researcher also recognized this socio-cultural predisposition differed from the majority of women
and children experiencing homelessness; and that an imbalance of power between researcher and
participants was predicated by this difference.
Prior work and volunteer experiences also serve to situate a researcher’s positionality.
This researcher brought to the case study knowledge and skills gained during prior employment

42

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
as an early intervention home visitation services provider. As a service provider the researcher
worked directly with families and young children experiencing trauma and crisis. In addition, the
researcher had been a volunteer at the research site prior to the investigation. As a volunteer for a
children’s literacy program, the researcher had multiple interactions with the children, and
informal conversations with shelter staff and volunteers, and occasional direct interactions with
mothers at the shelter. The experiences of volunteering in the shelter provided the researcher
unique insight into the dynamic characteristics of that particular shelter. Thus, impressions and
interpretations of the research situation gained through the lens of a service provider and a
experiences as a shelter volunteer were acknowledged and reflected upon before and during the
research process.
To further situate the positionality of the researcher in this case study, a brief discussion
of the manner in which the researcher gained entry to the research site and obtained individual
participants must be included. Shenton and Hayter (2004) proposed five strategies researchers
rely on to gain access to research sites. Strategies included the, (1) known sponsor approach, (2)
phased entry, (3) reciprocity, (4) openness, and (5) demonstration of professional suitability. By
employing several aspects of the strategies mentioned above, this researcher was able to gain
access to the research site and obtain information rich participants and key informants. The
initial step in gaining access was the researcher’s relationship with a known entity. This
researcher was affiliated with a well-established local research university. The shelter director
and staff were familiar with the credibility and suitability of researchers from this institution as
they were currently involved with a separate longitudinal research project sponsored by the
medical department within the same university. Secondly, and from a more personal level, this

43

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
researcher had communicated and interacted directly with shelter administrators and several staff
on multiple occasions.
The researcher had served at the research site as a volunteer with the children’s literacy
program administered by a local external organization. Openness was yet another method
utilized in gaining access to the shelter and obtaining participants. A clear outline of the aim of
the study and what was expected of participants was conveyed during discussions between the
shelter director and key informants. Specifically, the researcher offered each individual involved
with the study an overview of the literature review, the study purpose, research design, and study
timeline prior to and during the study period. The shelter director, staff, volunteers, and study
participants were assured by the researcher that the intent of the study was to explore children’s
play in an effort to understand the nature of play at that particular shelter. The researcher took
special precautions to avoid situations that may re-traumatize mothers and children at the shelter.
Traumatic life events precipitate family homelessness (i.e., domestic violence, sexual
abuse, chronic illness, eviction, foreclosure, natural disasters, and war). A guide to trauma
informed care processes and techniques found on The National Center for Family Homelessness
website informed this research process (Homeless Resource Center Guide, 2008; The National
Center on Family Homelessness, 2006). To increase researcher sensitivity and to avoid retraumatizing participants during this study, the researcher obtained background information from
shelter staff and volunteers regarding potential trauma triggers.
To address positionality and reflexivity, the researcher kept a reflective journal
throughout the study period. Journaling assisted the researcher with the process of thoughtfully
considering perspectives gained through experiences in the homeless shelter. The researcher

44

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
utilized the journal as a means for purposeful reflection and a type of cathartic strategy (Lincoln
& Guba, 1985).
Summary
Chapter 3 included an overview of the philosophical roots, methodological stance, and
methods utilized in this study; and an elaboration on the manner in which these approaches
related to the research design and processes. A description of, and rationale for the methodology
as it was situated within a qualitative paradigm grounded by social constructivist theory was
expounded upon. Exploratory single case study method was described as it was informed by
Yin’s case study approach (2009) and considered in relation to the rationale for the approach.
Trustworthiness of rigorous qualitative research was delineated as were strategies for ensuring
trustworthiness of the research process and findings. The philosophical and theoretical stance,
methodological approach, research design, and data collection methods were proficient in
meeting the aim of the study, which was to gain an understanding of the contextual nature of
play as it occurred in a residential shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness.
Chapter 4
Findings
Introduction
This chapter includes study findings gleaned from mothers’ perceptions of the nature of
play at an urban core emergency shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness.
Information garnered from key informants is also included. Shelter staff and volunteer
informants shared their unique knowledge pertaining to the daily routines, social interactions,
and the shelter’s history and mission, and program rules. Together this data was utilized to create
a rich and nuanced understanding of the nature of play in the context of a homeless shelter.

45

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Organization of the chapter. To situate the study findings this chapter begins with a
narrated portrait of each mother participating in the study. Next, an overview of the shelter
setting and daily routine are provided. The final sections of this chapter include the findings from
data analysis as they relate to the research question, and a description of the six themes presented
in narrative and table form. Also included in the final section is a discussion of additional
findings.
Narrated Portraits
Introduction. To gain a deep understanding of the roots of mother’s perceptions of play
at the homeless shelter, a narrated portrait of each mother is provided. The following section
introduces each of the six mothers individually and provides a brief summary of their lives based
on information collected during semi-structured interviews and informal conversations with each
mother. Additional information was gathered during semi-structured interviews and informal
conversations with shelter staff and volunteers, and also gleaned from observations and field
notes.
The six mothers, Monique, Vanessa, Colette, Starr, Tasha, and Aleesha agreed to
participate in the study and to share their stories—their memories, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs
steeped in individually constructed understandings of past and present experiences. Pseudonyms
were used to protect privacy and insure confidentiality of each individual.
Monique. Monique was a 37 year old mother of two children; a 24 month old daughter
named Kayla, and a 14 year old daughter who lived with her birth father. Monique and Kayla
lived at the shelter for 93 days. She had no car and relied on the public bus system. Monique had
experienced multiple episodes of homelessness over the past several years. She reported being
neglected during her childhood and abused and physically assaulted during childhood and again

46

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
as an adult. In a conversation about memories of childhood play, Monique reported that when
she was little she used to love playing in the mud and dirt. However, she incurred physical
injuries on multiple occasions while playing at a community playground during her childhood,
and since that time she has not felt safe outdoors and avoids being outside, particularly on
playgrounds. Monique expressed that, “my mother should have watched me better when I was
little.” After discussing her childhood memories, Monique reflected that she, “Never had a
relationship with my mom…she treated me like trash…I don’t know why she hates me so
much.”
Monique reported that Kayla suffered from breathing problems associated with playing
outside in the grass and therefore did not want Kayla to play in the grass at the shelter
playground. Monique also reported feeling fearful Kayla would sustain injuries while playing on
or near the playground equipment. She believed Kayla was safer indoors and asked the shelter
volunteers not to take Kayla outside during playtime. Monique reported being angry at
volunteers who disregarded her requests and brought Kayla outside to play.
Vanessa. Vanessa was a 30 year old mother of four children. The youngest, 4 year old
La’mon lived with her at the shelter. The three older children were living in foster care. Vanessa
and La’mon lived at the shelter a total of 61 days. She had no car and relied on the public bus
system or friends for transportation. La’mon’s father visited the shelter on several occasions, and
periodically La’mon spent the night or weekend with his father. Vanessa did not share any
memories of early childhood play. She did recall playing basketball in junior high and in high
school and that she enjoyed this activity.
Vanessa reported that her son’s play behaviors were the root of a good deal of issues she
had to deal with while living at the shelter. La’mon was observed to be a physically active,

47

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
curious 4 year old boy. He enjoyed running and playing chase with other children, and driving
toy cars around in the shelter dining room and lobby and out on the deck in the backyard. He was
happy when playing on the blacktop outside dribbling a basketball and practicing making shots
through the basketball hoop. La’mon also enjoyed the times when his mother would play
basketball with him. Vanessa communicated that she would like to have time to play basketball
with La’mon, stating that he could dribble and shoot a regular size basketball and make a basket.
Vanessa related that La’mon regularly tucked a toy or two away in his pockets at the end
of evening playtime in the playroom which was “against the shelter rules” and the volunteers and
staff gave her a hard time about this behavior. Due to his reputation for stowing toys in his
pockets, La’mon was regularly playfully patted down by a playroom volunteer before going
upstairs.
Vanessa openly expressed her discomfort with living at the shelter; she worked daily
scouring employment opportunities online to secure a job that would enable her to move out of
the shelter into a place of her own. She reported encountering hostility from the shelter staff and
other mothers who disapproved of La’mon’s behavior. Vanessa related being chastised by staff
and a few of the other mothers who felt she was not taking appropriate steps to make La’mon “sit
still and behave.” During the course of this study, one staff member was observed scolding
La’mon on several occasions, telling the child he was “being bad.” The same staff member was
also observed correcting Vanessa’s parenting practices. Vanessa related feeling angry and
stressed because she wanted to give her son the freedom to engage in the kinds of active play she
knew that he needed. She understood that La’mon had a strong desire to be physically active and
that he was curious about everything. However, she was worried about the consequences of not
following the shelter rules and requests of the staff members; so she had to “get after him” and

48

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
“keep on him” to sit still. Vanessa was frustrated by the fact that families had to spend so much
time on the main floor of the shelter. In this space children were expected to either be sitting at
the dining room table or on the couch in the lobby waiting while their mothers tended to
household chores or other responsibilities. There were no toys or books available on the main
floor for children to engage with. The only authorized play spaces in the shelter were the
playroom in the basement or the playground located in the backyard of the shelter. Use of both
spaces was restricted by shelter rules. The playroom was available for one hour, four evenings
per week—Monday through Thursday from 7 to 8 pm, while mothers attended life skills
classes—and only with a volunteer. The playground could be used only when children were
accompanied by their mother.
Colette. Colette was 30 years old and had a 4 year old daughter, Nola. Colette and Nola
resided at the shelter a total of 84 days. She owned her own car. Colette related bits and pieces of
her background primarily during informal conversations out on the deck while she smoked.
The shelter was the fifth location she and Nola had lived in within the past three years.
Colette communicated that she had lived in a shelter previously. Colette had experienced
domestic violence when Nola was about 2 years old. Colette was sent to the emergency room
with multiple injuries including a broken arm. Afterwards, Colette took Nola with her to a local
shelter for domestic violence survivors; living there for two months until she was able to “get
back on [her] feet.”
After living at the shelter for domestic violence survivors, Colette and Nola eventually
moved in with friends. Colette, and Nola who was 3 by that time, lived doubled-up with close
friends living out of state. This arrangement ended abruptly when the pet dog belonging to the
family they were doubled-up with bit Nola in the face. Nola was hospitalized. As soon as Nola

49

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
was stable to travel, she and Colette moved back to the city to live with Colette’s mother. During
this time Nola received months of medical treatments necessitated by the dog attack. Once
Nola’s wounds had healed, she and Colette moved to a place of their own. This lasted until
Colette lost her temporary job. Colette was unable to keep up with the monthly bills and was
evicted for non-payment of rent. Colette applied for assistance through the homeless services
system in the city and she and Nola were placed at the emergency shelter two months prior to the
study.
Shortly after moving into the shelter Colette secured full-time employment working
second-shift as a cook in an assisted living facility. Nola attended a home-based childcare
program that was operated by a family friend. Colette reported that Nola had established trusting
relationships with her childcare provider and also with the provider’s elementary aged children.
Colette stated that she felt good that Nola had a safe supportive place to go while she was at
work.
Colette was one of two mothers participating in the study who had a car. She purchased
it toward the end of the study with money she had saved from her current job. Colette stated how
happy she was to be able to purchase a car with her own money; she related how relieved she
was that she and Nola no longer had to rely on the bus for transportation. Colette reported that
using the bus to ride to and from childcare and work was a grueling process. The nearest bus stop
was over a mile from where she worked, and she disliked the walk when the weather was bad.
When riding the bus, Colette and Nola had to leave the shelter two hours before Colette had to be
at work to ensure she would arrive on time. The two of them would leave at 10am and return to
the shelter by 9:30 pm. Nola generally looked sleepy and acted irritable and Colette appeared
tired by the time they arrived back at the shelter for the night. The following day they would get

50

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
up and go through the process all over again. Colette generally worked every other weekend.
Nola often stayed with the childcare provider during the weekends Colette worked.
Starr. Starr was 23 and the mother of two children, 5 month old son Terrel, and 17 month
old daughter Sheymani; both lived with her at the shelter. Starr and her two children lived at the
shelter for 75 days. She had no car and relied on public transportation. Starr’s daughter
Sheymani was curious about everything in her world; she enjoyed climbing and jumping on
furniture, and playing with her mother on the playground. Terrel, was a happy baby; generally
content to visually examine his environment from the seat of his stroller or infant carrier, and coo
and babble back and forth with his mother. Both Sheymani and Terrel attended daycare located
several miles from the shelter. During discussions about play at the shelter, Starr expressed that
she had never been to the basement playroom. Starr explained that she felt uncomfortable about
the thought of being in a basement, and therefore would not go downstairs to the shelter
playroom. Starr was one of only a few of the mothers observed playing with her children on the
playground periodically.
Starr related that she and her two sisters were raised by her grandmother. She recalled
playing outdoors “every chance we could get…even in winter…we had fun.” Starr stated she
was “a very active child”, and that she spent time playing with siblings at local parks and
playgrounds. Starr stated that she didn’t “remember playing with neighbors” when she was a
child, but recalled riding bikes, jumping rope, and playing hide ‘n seek with her sisters.
Starr reported moving four times before coming to this shelter. She had lived in her own
apartment, spent two months in a shelter, and also lived doubled-up with relatives. Starr and her
two children had lived with her grandmother, and then most recently with her sister. Starr’s sister
had four elementary school aged children. According to Starr her sister, “always had a lot of stuff

51

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
everywhere…was always something [the children] could pick up off the floor....that wasn’t
supposed to be there.” Starr expressed her frustration with her situation and the uncertainties
associated with working temporary jobs. She stated that she couldn’t pay the rent for her last
apartment because her temporary employment ended and couldn’t find work soon enough to earn
the rent money she needed. Starr said she needed and wanted permanent full-time work in order
to live independently. Starr stated that she had a criminal record due to, “being in the wrong
place…with the wrong people.” Her record made her ineligible for government subsidized
housing and therefore she had to pay market rate for rent. Starr was on a wait list for low-income
housing and searched daily for a full-time permanent job, which was difficult to find due to her
criminal record. As was the case for nearly each mother at the shelter, Starr devoted many hours
daily searching out and applying for job openings. Starr was hired for a permanent part-time
position working for a general retail store. Because she relied on public transportation, Starr
switched from the childcare program her children currently attended, to one more conveniently
located along the bus routes and where she worked and would eventually live.
Tasha. Tasha was 25 years old and mother of a 27 month old daughter named, Lena who
lived with her at the shelter, and an 11 year old daughter who lived with Tasha’s maternal
grandparents. Tasha and Lena resided at the shelter a total of 58 days before transitioning to a
long-term shelter program. She had no car and relied on the public bus system. Tasha had lived
with her mother and siblings in the local community all her life. She and her eight siblings were
raised by “strict” parents who prohibited the children from playing with anyone in their
neighborhood, because it was a “bad” community. Tasha had experienced homelessness, neglect
and sexual abuse during her childhood and early adolescents. Tasha gave birth to her first child
at age 14. She continued her education in the community school district in spite of being bullied

52

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
by her peers and siblings during her pregnancy. Soon after her birth, Tasha’s daughter was
diagnosed with epilepsy and required daily medication. Tasha’s mother provided childcare while
Tasha attended school. However, Tasha’s mother was unable to provide appropriate care and
Tasha’s maternal grandparents were given custody of her daughter. Tasha did well academically
and went on to graduate from high school.
When Tasha gave birth to her second child, Lena, she was still living at home with her
mother and eight siblings. Tasha and Lena spent most of the time in their bedroom located on the
third floor of the home. Tasha reported having few toys and books for Lena to play with. Lena
had no playmates her age, only a few school age cousins. Tasha related that she rarely brought
Lena outdoors to play because the neighborhood was not safe. Tasha stated that she would play
with Lena, pretending to be an animal such as a cat, tiger, or dog, and that she and Lena enjoyed
playing together this way.
Several months prior to moving to the shelter, Lena suffered an accident while in their
home. Tasha stated that a cup of boiling water accidentally splashed onto one side of Lena’s face
and neck causing severe burns. Lena was hospitalized and required frequent visits to the local
Burn Institute for months afterwards. When Tasha and Lena arrived at the shelter, Lena’s speech
was difficult to understand; and the damaged skin on Lena’s face and neck was beginning to
peel. By the end of her stay at the shelter, Lena’s expressive language skills had improved, and
her face appeared to be nearly healed.
Tasha communicated that she moved to the shelter because her mother, “threw me out of
the house… put me out.” Tasha stated that her mother told her she had to find another place to
live because it was too crowded in the home and there was not enough money to support them.
As every mother had to do when moving to this shelter, Tasha had to leave most of her

53

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
possessions behind. Per shelter policy, Tasha brought two weeks’ worth of clothing and
necessities for herself and Lena. Tasha appeared to keep primarily to herself during meals and
when completing chores. During one conversation, Tasha revealed that she, “…wanted to follow
the rules… mind my own business and stay out of trouble.”
Tasha would take Lena to the city park once or twice each week. She used the public bus
system to travel back and forth from the shelter to the park downtown. Before leaving the shelter
to visit the park, Tasha would pack a large bag with extra clothing and diapers, and sandwiches,
snacks, and drinks made available in the kitchen. Tasha would spend the day at the playground
with Lena. She stated that Lena would play with the other children at the playground in the sand
area, or that she would push Lena on the swings. Tasha said that it was, “nice to be able to go
there.” Tasha would leave the park in time to catch a bus to return to the shelter before the 5:45
pm curfew. Other days Tasha reported that she would “play pretend” with Lena in their bedroom
or the lounge area outside the bedrooms, and that she would also sit in the dining room and read
a magazine while Lena had a snack.
Aleesha. Aleesha was 38 years old and had three children, Lizzy her 33 month old
daughter, a six year old son, and a 14 year old daughter. Aleesha chose not to move her six year
old son with her to this city because he was in school and doing well living with Aleesha’s aunt
out of state. Aleesha’s 14 year old daughter lived with the child’s biological father who had legal
custody. Aleesha and Lizzy lived at the shelter for a total of 60 days. Aleesha was one of two
mothers participating in the study that had a car.
Aleesha and Lizzy came to the shelter soon after moving to this city. She had been living
with her aunt for several years out of state. Upon moving back to this city, she found few social
supports to assist her with childcare or housing, and was unable to find enough work to pay rent.

54

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Doubling-up with her mother who resided in this city was not an option; Aleesha explained the
situation stating, “She helped me once…I would have to lose my right arm before she would
help me again.”
Aleesha reported that she and two of her children had previously spent one night in a
homeless shelter. She had received an eviction notice weeks prior but was unable to come up
with enough rent money to avoid being ordered to leave the following day. Aleesha stated that,
being evicted meant the police come and tell you to leave and then they move everything you
own out of your home and set it out on the street. To avoid the ordeal of being “kicked out”,
Aleesha stated that she packed up a few belongings and she and her children lived in her car “for
a day or so”, until she found a shelter that would take them in. She expressed that, “it was an
awful experience” and she hated putting her children in that situation. After spending one night
in the shelter with her two children, Aleesha was able to persuade her mother to let them stay
with her until other arrangements could be made. Afterwards, Aleesha relocated out of state and
lived with her aunt before returning to the city.
One week after moving to the shelter, Aleesha was driving back from an appointment
with the local Jobs and Family Services program. In the car were her daughter Lizzy, and another
mother and her infant son. Several blocks from the shelter, Aleesha’s car was struck by another
driver who ran a stop sign. They were transported to a nearby hospital, examined and released.
The two mothers suffered minor injuries and bruising; the children had been in their car seats and
suffered no physical injuries. Aleesha’s car was deemed a total loss by her insurance company.
In the end she owed more money on the car than she collected from the insurance claim. The
accident left Aleesha reliant on public transportation; she also had to continue making payments
on the bank loan for the car she no longer had. For several weeks after the accident Aleesha

55

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
reported being tired most of the time, suffering from headaches, a loss of appetite, and feeling
overwhelmed by the loss of her car. Aleesha went back to the emergency room several days after
the accident due to pain in her side and head and was kept overnight for observation. It was not
clear where Lizzy was while Aleesha was in the hospital for the night. Aleesha reported being
“prescribed some medications for pain” then was released from the hospital. Once back at the
shelter, Aleesha busied herself with searching for housing and employment opportunities, and
attending life skills classes and meetings with the shelter case manager. This continued until
September 2015 when Aleesha and Lizzy moved into a local transitional housing program.
Summary. The mothers imparted their perceptions of play while navigating the
experiences of life at the emergency homeless shelter. Three of the participating mothers were
living at the shelter prior to the start of the study and three mothers moved into the shelter and
agreed to participate while the study was in process. Monique with Kayla, her 24 month old
daughter, Vanessa with La’mon, her four year old son, and Colette with Nola, her four year old
daughter, were living at the shelter for more than one month prior to the study. Three mothers,
Starr with Terrel, her five month old son and Sheymani, her 17 month old daughter, Tasha with
Lena, her 24 month old daughter, and Aleesha with Lizzy, her 33 month old daughter, moved
into the shelter approximately five weeks after the initial three mothers were interviewed.
Vanessa and Monique, two mothers living at the shelter prior to the start of the study,
exited the shelter with their children prior to the photo elicitation group interview. Neither
mother provided contact information. Vanessa exited first, followed ten days later by Monique.
Shelter staff expressed that both Vanessa and Monique conducted an “improper exit” which is
defined in the shelter rules. This type of exit meant that the mothers did not follow procedures

56

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
stipulated for leaving the shelter, and therefore the mothers would not be eligible for services
from the organization in the future.
Starr, Tasha, and Aleesha participated in the photo elicitation group interview at the close
of the study on August 14th, 2015. A conflict with her work schedule detained Colette and kept
her from attending the photo elicitation group interview. A follow-up interview was conducted
with Colette on September 9th, 2015. At the time of the follow-up interview, Colette had moved
from the emergency shelter into transitional housing with her daughter. A follow-up interview
was also conducted with Tasha, who requested to stay in contact after she had moved from the
shelter. Tasha and her daughter were transferred into a long-term shelter program serving women
and children in need of more specialized services.
Each of the six mothers related that they had experienced at least one prior episode of
homelessness during their lifetimes. Tasha, with her mother and eight siblings, had experienced
homelessness as a young child. Monique, Vanessa, Colette, Starr, and Aleesha reported
experiencing one or more episodes of homelessness within the past few years. The mothers
reported experiencing multiple traumatic events over the course of their lifetimes. These events
ranged from childhood neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and rape, to evictions, convictions,
and domestic violence. Mothers expressed feelings of intense sadness and despair related to the
overwhelming challenges of their individual circumstances. The mothers communicated that
they understood children were also facing stress of transitioning to shelter life, and therefore it
was important that children be able to experience the sense of freedom and joy that comes from
play, so they could feel more “normal”.
During interviews and informal conversations, mothers shared memories of their own
past childhood play experiences, and reflected on play interactions they engaged in with their

57

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
children prior to moving to the shelter. Mothers discussed their perceptions of negative as well as
positive aspects associated with children’s play at the shelter. Mothers reported that watching
and playing with their children gave them a sense of happiness and freedom. Mothers stated that
they were able to rest while their children played—offering a precious reprieve from the stress of
daily responsibilities. When discussing details of moments they played with or were able to
watch their child at play, the mothers’ smiled broadly and their faces beamed with joy; the
mothers took on a brief peaceful, calm demeanor. Analysis of observational and field note data
of mothers’ and children’s daily lives at the shelter indicated that mothers and children
experienced brief, sporadic moments of happiness. This was indicated in verbalizations and tone
of voice, and through mother-child interactions, which included shared experiences of laughter,
smiles, gentle touches, hugs, and playful verbalizations (e.g., “Can I have a kiss?”; “I’m going to
get you.”).
Context for Findings
The structure of the shelter’s daily routine was a major influence on the lived experiences
of the mothers and children participating in the study. The daily routine was governed by
established rules and expectations for behavior. Mothers who were considered to be out of
compliance with shelter rules were at risk of being dismissed from the shelter. During the study
period the shelter was operating at capacity—each bedroom was occupied by multiple families.
Mothers requesting shelter services were placed on a wait list until an opening became available.
Space was a precious commodity at the shelter; several rooms served dual purposes (the
playroom was also used as a place for storage; strollers lined one wall of the main floor hallway,
and another wall was used to store boxes and bags of surplus donated clothing and toys),
bedrooms were shared with at least one other mother and her children. One laptop computer was

58

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
located in the conference room on the main floor. Mothers shared the computer to conduct
searches for housing and employment. Negotiating turns with the bathrooms was an ongoing
issue families had to navigate during high use periods (i.e., mornings and evenings after chores
were completed).
Intake. Each new mother was interviewed by a shelter staff immediately upon arrival at
the home to gather demographic information and to orient mothers to the rules, expectations, and
routine of the shelter. Demographic and personal information were collected during the
interview. The interview included questions pertaining to the mother’s history of homelessness,
health needs, and social supports. Mothers were briefed of shelter rules and routines as part of
the intake process. After the intake meeting was completed mothers were directed to their
bedroom and left on their own with belongings and children in tow to navigate the set of stairs
leading to the bedrooms.
During a typical intake meeting, a shelter staff member met with the mother while her
children either sat with her in the office, or waited in an adjoining room. The adjoining room had
three chairs along one wall and a large container holding trial sized personal hygiene items (e.g.,
soap, shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste) located underneath a table placed against the opposite
wall. Sometimes another staff member would offer children a coloring book and crayons, or a
small plush toy to play with. While waiting for their mother, children would often explore the
room and the container of small bottles on the floor; pretending to fly or drive the items around
the room and on the chairs.
Shelter rules. A shelter staff reviewed the list of shelter rules with the mother. Shelter
rules clearly spelled out expectations for all residents. Mothers were informed upon arrival that
violation of shelter rules was grounds for dismissal from the shelter. For example, mothers could

59

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
be dismissed from the shelter if they incurred more than one instance of missing the evening
curfew. Other shelter rules included: Children were not permitted in the kitchen at any time;
mothers were prohibited from caring for the children of other mothers residing at the shelter; at
no time were mothers and children permitted in another mother’s bedroom—discussions among
mothers were restricted to the common spaces of the shelter (e.g., lobby, dining room, hallways,
lounge area outside bedrooms, and outdoors); children were to be supervised by mothers at all
times without exception; children were not to run indoors, climb or jump on furniture or stairs.
Staff as well as other mothers would inform mothers when children needed closer supervision
and discipline. Children’s play behaviors, crying and screaming were met with staff comments
such as, “You need to quiet him/her down…Shut-up…They can’t be on the stairs…He/she is
being bad…They can’t be in there.” Shelter rules pertaining to food and the pursuit of obtaining
resources were strictly enforced and violation was grounds for dismissal. Examples of two such
rules include: (1) “No food should be brought into the shelter or on the premises” and, (2)
Mothers and children are expected to, “be out of the shelter during each week day pursuing
community resources.”
Families were required to have morning chores completed by 10:00 am Monday through
Friday. After 10:00 am mothers were expected to attend appointments, and search for housing,
employment, and education opportunities. Staff scheduled meetings with mothers who were not
following through on the requirement to work towards secure housing and employment. Staff
also reminded mothers when children required closer supervision and discipline.
Assigned chores. Assigned chores were posted in the kitchen by a staff member twice
daily; the morning chores were posted by 9:00 am and the after dinner chores were posted by
6:00 pm. Mothers completed morning chores by 10:00 am. Morning chores included: Washing,

60

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
drying and putting away breakfast dishes, wiping off dining room table and chairs, sweeping up
any debris accumulated during breakfast, making beds, and washing, drying, and putting away
laundry. After the morning chores, mothers prepared to leave the shelter for the day. This
preparation entailed: gathering items necessary for their child (e.g., food, drinks, diapers, wipes,
change of clothing), appropriate bus fare, and any documents needed for appointments. Strollers
donated to the shelter were available for mothers to use during the day. Mothers and children
typically returned to the shelter between 3:00 pm and 5:30 pm; often retreating to their bedroom
to lie down for a nap soon after returning.
Mothers worked on after dinner chores until it was time for the life skills class at 7:00
pm. The after dinner chores included: Cleaning up leftover food and drinks, washing, drying and
putting away dinner dishes, cleaning kitchen countertops and stove tops, wiping down dining
room tables and chairs, and sweeping and mopping dining room and kitchen floors.
Dinner. The dinner meal was scheduled to be served at 6:00 pm daily. Mothers and their
children were expected to be cleaned up and sitting in the dining room by 6:00 pm. Community
organizations volunteered to provide meals three to four nights per week. If volunteers arrived
late, or didn’t show up at all, dinner would be served when a staff member was able to prepare
it—anywhere from 6:15-7:00 pm. During the study period it was observed that dinner was
typically served at 6:00 pm; however, when dinner was served late, the mothers and children
were expected to sit and wait in the dining room. While waiting, the sound of the mothers talking
to each other or on cell phones, children talking, crying, yelling, or laughing in the dining room
seemed to elevate to nearly unbearable levels at times. When this occurred, a staff member
would walk down from an office upstairs and yell for the families to “quiet down!”

61

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Between 6:45 and 7:00 pm a volunteer arrived and escorted children from the dining
room where they were sitting, to the playroom in the basement, or outside to the playground
located in the fenced in backyard. At 8:00 pm children are escorted by the volunteer from the
playroom or playground to the main floor of the shelter where their mothers would meet them.
Mothers had free time after life skills classes until 9:00 pm when they were permitted to go
upstairs to their bedrooms.
Life skills classes. Attendance was mandatory for all life skills classes. Classes focused
on topics of health and nutrition, parenting, and budgeting, and were facilitated by shelter staff or
a nurse from the community. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday classes were conducted in a
conference room located on the main floor of the shelter after dinner, from 7:00-8:00 pm. Yoga
classes were provided on Tuesdays by a local non-profit organization.
Curfew. The shelter staff enforced a nighttime curfew. Monday through Thursday
mothers and children had to be in the shelter no later than 5:45 pm unless they had made prior
arrangements with shelter staff. Friday and Saturday curfew was 10:30 pm and Sunday curfew
was 9:00 pm. When a mother “failed to return to the shelter” it was considered an “improper
exit.” A mother improperly exiting the shelter was prohibited from receiving future assistance
from that shelter. Personal items belonging to mothers who improperly exited were disposed of
immediately.
Transportation. The shelter provided bus passes for mothers to attend appointments.
Mothers described the challenges of commuting to and from job interviews with their children in
tow. One mother, Starr described what it was like to ride the bus to and from a job interview with
her daughter walking beside her and her infant son in a stroller. Starr explained that she and her
children traveled the two blocks to the appropriate bus stop, where she loaded the children, a

62

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
stroller, and a diaper bag full of necessities for the day, onto a bus for the “ride to daycare.”
Starr then had to catch another bus for a ride to the interview. After the interview, Starr then
caught a bus to return to daycare to retrieve her children. Once collecting her children and their
belongings she must load the children, stroller, and diaper bag on a bus for the ride back to the
bus stop. Finally she and her children traverse the couple of blocks back to the shelter. Starr
stated that she was anxious to “get her own place…then get a car.”
The story related above was experienced, to some degree, by each mother with young
children living at the shelter. When families returned to the shelter in the evening they were tired
and hungry. After a day of navigating challenges inherent in working with social services
programs (e.g., jobs and family service programs or health clinics) and commuting on public
buses with children in tow, mothers and children often appeared drained and worn down; the
children were often irritable. The evening meal however, seemed to revive the mothers and
satisfy the children enough that mothers were able to the attend life skills class and complete
their evening tasks by 9:00 p.m. when they were permitted to go upstairs to their bedrooms.
Analysis of Data
Data analysis indicated that mothers’ perceptions of play were grounded in memories of
play experiences from three distinct points in their lives: childhood, pre-shelter, and present. A
concern for safety was also a prominent lens framing mothers’ perceptions of play. Throughout
interviews and informal discussions of play experiences at the shelter, each of the mothers
conveyed feelings of stress, anxiety, and frustration, as well as feelings of happiness and hope.
Mothers expressed frustration and anxiety over barriers they believed limited children’s play.
Constraints barring mothers’ capacity to play with and to observe their child at play were
primary factors associated with frustration and anxiety. Mothers reported that a major barrier to

63

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
play at the shelter were the shelter rules governing the daily routine. Mothers conveyed feeling
positive about the size of the playroom, the quantity of playroom materials, and the variety of
playground equipment. The mothers also shared hopes for future play experiences with their
child once they moved to a place of own.
Play perceived through mothers’ memories
Childhood memories of play. To set the stage for each interview, one of the first probes
asked mothers to discuss their childhood play experiences. Memories of play during childhood
included: unstructured outdoor and indoor activities with siblings or neighborhood friends.
Four mothers remembered playing outdoors with siblings or friends most frequently.
Early play memories included activities such as: pretend play, dress-up, board games, riding
bikes, jumping rope. Mothers reflected about, “games with kids in the apartment complex;
play[ing] ‘til the street lights came on at night” or, “jump rope outside…hide and seek with my
two sisters”, and play at the park to “swing and slide…with my sisters.”
Vanessa said she had little memory of play from when she was young. Her memories of
play centered on the period in her life when she played basketball in school. Vanessa said
however that, “When I think of children playing I think of them having fun outside.” Tasha
reported that during her childhood she was only permitted to play with siblings, stating, “I wasn’t
allowed to play with neighborhood kids [because] my parents were strict.” She did recall
enjoying time spent, “playing school… playing with Barbie dolls…hop scotch… swinging and
riding bikes.” Monique recalled that she “used to play outside in the dirt and mud when I was
little” but that she really had “no good memories of playing outdoors”, stating it was “not safe.”
She spoke of being severely injured on multiple occasions while playing at the community
playground as a child, and reported, “I don’t like…being outside now.” Monique lamented, “My

64

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
mother should have supervised me more.” Overall, four of the six mothers described their
childhood play as a time of freedom; as unstructured time spent having fun and feeling carefree.
Memories of play prior to shelter. During interviews, mothers also reflected on play
interactions they experienced with their children prior to living at the homeless shelter. Mothers
indicated that play at the shelter differed from play with their child before moving to the shelter.
Some mothers felt treasured routines were disrupted; such as bath time play, playing basketball,
or watching television with their child. Several mothers said they believed play at the shelter was
limited due to shelter rules and shared spaces.
Still others communicated that the shelter offered more room and variety of items to play
with than where they had lived previously. For example, when asked what play was like before
moving to the shelter Tasha relayed that she and her daughter had limited space, and few toys
and materials to play with at their previous home. Tasha stated that she and her daughter were
generally restricted to the bedroom they shared “up on the 3rd floor of [her] mother’s home.”
Several mothers commented that prior to moving to the shelter, their children had few
opportunities to play freely outdoors. Their reasons included, the “community was not safe”, the
yard was “too close to the street”, or the yard bordered woods that were considered unsafe.
Play at the shelter. Several of the mothers clearly communicated their thoughts about
play at the shelter by stating bluntly that, “it’s hard here.” Aleesha expressed that it was hard at
the shelter “for kids to be themselves…because of the nature of the situation.” She said, “moms
have to make children more constrained than would in own home” due to the rules and shared
spaces. Commenting on the more positive aspects of the shelter, four of the six mothers stated
they viewed the vast amount of toys and outdoor equipment as offering potential for children to
engage in rich stimulating play activities.

65

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Mothers commented on the vast number of toys in the playroom, saying, “they have a
whole bunch of stuff for them to be occupied with…there’s a lot for them to do down there.”
Mothers considered the playroom to be a large space with a variety of toys and materials, and
therefore offering opportunities for children to play and learn. For example, Tasha stated that the
shelter playroom “is a big space with a lot of toys.” She expressed that because there were a lot
of toys to play with, children had the opportunity to “explore, learn different things…ways of
playing.” However, the number of toys was also perceived as a possible barrier to play. When
talking about the playroom, Tasha stated that having so many toys, “might be overwhelming for
her [child]”; and that the child, “might not know what to do; what to play with…where to start
‘cause a lot of toys.”
The playground was considered a space large enough for children to run around and use
up energy. Tasha explained that having access to the playground equipment at the shelter
enabled her daughter the chance to learn, “ways of doing something” such as, “figure out how to
go up the slide.”
Safety. Safety was another lens mothers perceived play through. Starr indicated that the
shelter playroom and the house in general, were more child-proof than where she and her family
had lived previously. Starr, her 5 month old and 2 year old had lived with her grandmother, and
then moved to her sister’s home. Her sister had four elementary aged children of her own. Starr
stated that, “there was always something [her daughter] was trying to get in… [there was] a lot of
stuff everywhere… [it was] out of order and messy.” Starr noted that, “here it’s like…I guess
you could say it’s more restricted [children are not permitted in the kitchens and living
room]…and here they have outlet plugs.” Monique expressed the opposite view; saying that play
at the shelter was not safe for her child. Monique’s daughter was 2 years old and her mother

66

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
reported that she was curious about everything. Monique said she believed the home and grounds
were unsafe due to inappropriate supervision by volunteers in the playroom and on the
playground. Monique stated that, “people take [my child] downstairs [to the playroom] and there
are things down there that shouldn’t be and the people down there don’t watch and they don’t
care.”
Findings
Findings were based on evidence gathered to answer the research question, How is play
perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of a residential shelter for
women and children?
Themes interpreted through a social constructivist lens, were identified from patterns
emanating from the narrative summaries compiled during analysis of interview data. Theme
selection was based on logical alignment with the research question. The researcher considered
two primary themes and four subthemes displayed in Table 2 as conceptual representations of
mothers' perceptions of play. Two primary themes were identified during analysis: (1) Play is
important for children and mothers and, (2) Play is associated with loss and uncertainty. Four
subthemes were also identified: (1a) Freedom from stress; (1b) Opportunities for growth; (2a)
It’s hard here; and, (2b) Disruption of routines. Together, the six themes created a thick
understanding of the bounded case—mothers’ perceptions of play in a homeless shelter for
women and children.

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Presentation of Themes and Subthemes
Play is Important for Children and Mothers. The data clearly indicated that mothers’
perceived play to be important for children; and that it was also an important factor in their own
lives as well. Mothers considered early play experiences to act as mechanisms for healthy growth
and development. Mothers reported gaining a sense of joy and purpose when playing with their
child and also while observing their child at play. Mothers expressed that play experiences had
the effect of decreasing stress associated with poverty and homelessness.
Mothers indicated that children have a need and right to play, and considered this an
important aspect of childhood. They understood the importance of play in the lives of their
children; this was evidenced in statements such as, “Kids want to play; that’s what kids do…are
supposed to play”; and that it is through play interactions, “kids are developing who they are.”
Play was perceived as important in a child’s life because, “kids need to be able to run…to get
out, get fresh air and release energy… need to explore…to be themselves.” When reflecting on
play in relation to life at the shelter, Aleesha expressed, “At least children have a chance to
play… if not with me, then at least with the volunteer and other children.” For the mothers, play
was an inseparable part of childhood. Starr summed this up when she stated, “children will play
anywhere with anything…and they should be allowed to play.” When asked what kids do at the
shelter, Tina, a staff member stated that they play; that “they’re…being kids…doing what kids
do.”
Freedom from stress. The interview data revealed mothers harbored strong sentiments
about the connection between play and being free of stress. Aleesha stated that staff, volunteers,
and other moms need to remember that it is, “important to understand kids need to be able to be
kids, have fun…that moms should take some time out to play with kids…go to the park to play.”

68

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Mothers stated that children are able to regain a sense of normalcy during play activities at the
shelter. Aleesha, Tasha, and Starr explicitly stated play provided opportunities where the “kids
can feel normal”. Lena conveyed that children experience what it’s like, “to be a kid without a
care in the world” when playing. Tasha shared that, “It makes me feel good when I play with
[my daughter].” Mothers also reported that play activities gave them a break from the worries
and stress associated with the challenges of homelessness. Tasha conveyed, “After a busy
stressful day…it feels good to see her [daughter] play…I like to play with her.” She further
expressed that, “I feel happy inside; makes me feel good to see children laughing, having fun.”
Starr adamantly stated, “It doesn’t give us a break when kids can only go to playroom with the
volunteer…cause volunteer only here for one hour four nights a week!”
Staff, volunteers, and mothers commented that when children play, moms are able to
take a momentary break from everyday responsibilities. One staff member stated that, “generally
moms use play time as a time to take a rest from business of the day.” Shelter staff and
volunteers related how mothers use the deck which overlooks the playground as an area to
smoke. It is a shelter rule that children are to be with their parents at all times, thus, when
mothers go outside to smoke, “kids get a chance to play outdoors.” In addition to this
information, data from observations and field notes indicated that the more frequently a mother
smoked, the more opportunities a child had to play outdoors on the deck, blacktop space, and
playground, see Figures 1, 2, and 3 below.

ages played together.

Figure 3. Toddler area of playground.

Growth. Play was perceived as a time when children could “develop who they are” and
use their “creative imagination.” Tasha expressed that she would like opportunities to use the
playroom to not only play with her daughter, but also so they could sit together and “read some
of the books with my child.” Mothers perceived that children could gain positive social skills
through play with peers at the shelter. Vanessa stated that there were “better behaved kids here
[at the shelter] than neighborhood we came from”, and each of the mothers conveyed that there
70

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
were “more kids here to play with… more opportunities to play with children their age.” Mothers
expressed the belief that there was greater potential for children to expend energy, use their
muscles, explore and use their imagination outdoors because the large playground space and
variety of outdoor play equipment available at the shelter surpassed what they had available at
their previous home. The mothers communicated agreement that the playroom, depicted in
Figure 4 offered, “More space and more toys for [children] to play with than where [they] were
living.”

Figure 4. Shelter playroom.

Play Associated with Loss and Uncertainty
Several of the mothers indicated they were never in the playroom and wished they had
opportunities to see their child play and to play with their child in the playroom. Aleesha related
she was only in the playroom once, which was when she was assigned to clean the toys and tidy
up the room. Aleesha expressed that her assigned chore one evening was to straighten up the
playroom with another mother. She commented that she wouldn’t mind cleaning the playroom if
she were permitted to use the playroom with her child. Aleesha shared her thoughts about how

71

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
wonderful it would be if they were able to play with their children in the playroom space because
it had such a large variety of toys and materials. “We have to clean up the playroom, but can’t
take our kids there…parents should be allowed to take their kids to the playroom.”
Mothers wanted to know what their children do when they are with volunteers. Mothers
were uncertain what children do when playing in the playroom or on the playground because
they were not with them. Children were kept occupied in the playroom or on the playground by
volunteers while mothers attended a mandatory one hour long life skills class four evenings per
week, see Figure 5.

Figure 5. Volunteer with child in shelter playroom.

Monique, Colette, Starr, Tasha, and Aleesha each expressed a desire to know what their
child did in the playroom and on the playground with the volunteer and the other children. The
mothers wanted to understand how their child behaved when playing with the children in that
space and what toys the children enjoyed playing with most. Monique stated that, “I know she
likes to play with toys…she is infatuated with dogs…stuffed animals…I bought her a stuffed toy
dog…she don’t have it no more…we had to leave it [when they were evicted from their

72

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
apartment].” Monique further explained, “I don’t know what the volunteers do with my child…it
would be nice if I could see her when she plays [in the playroom with the toys].” After observing
a small child take a marble out of his pocket and put it in his mouth, Monique expressed her
concerns for the safety of her child when in the playroom with volunteers. Monique stated that
her child was, “not going down in the playroom no more… there are things down there that
shouldn’t be and the people down there don’t watch, they don’t care.”
Mothers indicated wanting to play with their children; however, they said they were,
“always working, constantly trying to accomplish a goal…had no time and no energy to play.”
Statements from staff and volunteers reiterated what mothers communicated, expressing that,
“moms are scheduled…busy most of the time…don’t have time for play.”
It’s hard here. Mothers communicated that there was little time to help children gain a
sense of normalcy while at the shelter. The mothers wanted to provide the play experiences they
knew their children needed. Vanessa reported that she felt restricted as a parent. She stated that
the rules enforced by shelter staff inhibited her ability to allow “my child to play naturally, the
way a child is supposed to and needs to play.” The mothers explained that it was normal for
children “to be curious…want to explore” and to run, jump, climb, make noise and be messy.
Mothers reported that the behaviors they perceived to be “normal” for children, were often
deemed disruptive or destructive by staff and at times, other mothers. Aleesha stated that, “you
have to keep kids quiet so you don’t get into trouble.” Tasha reported that she would not take her
daughter outside to play on the playground because she believed it was against shelter rules for
mothers to do so, stating that she wanted to follow the rules and not cause trouble. Aleesha also
conveyed her frustration with trying to balance her child’s needs with following the shelter rules.

73

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Aleesha related that, “Kids have to sneak to play inside [the shelter]”, and that, “It’s like taking
kids to a candy store and saying don’t touch.”
Mothers communicated that children were not taken to the playroom Fridays through
Sundays because there were no life skills classes scheduled at that time and therefore there were
no volunteers to take children to the playroom. Conversations with staff and volunteers
confirmed this information. The mothers reported that they spent most of their time in their
bedrooms while at the shelter during the day and on the weekends.
Mothers reported playing most often with their child in their bedrooms. Mothers also
acknowledged engaging in some play with children in the common area located outside the
bedrooms or dining room, or while sitting at the dining room table. The mothers stated that they
played with their child primarily on the bed or bedroom floor.
Colette reported that, “there are no toys up there [in common area outside
bedrooms]…only toys in the playroom.” When asked where she and her daughter play together
and what they do when they play, Tasha explained that she had the most fun with her daughter,
“in our room on the bed…we pretend with a stuffed animal…play peek-a-boo and tickle.”
Monique reported that her daughter, “likes me to chase her in the lounge upstairs” and that her
daughter enjoyed playing on the bed. Play activities on the bed however were perceived as a
safety concern; Monique believed this activity was “dangerous…it’s up high and she [her
daughter] hit her head on the frame.” Mothers expressed that their children were always with
them no matter where they were or what they were doing, with the exception of the four times
each week when mothers attended life skills classes. Starr expressed, “there needs to be
somewhere for kids to play during the day besides their bedroom…it’s hard to keep kids

74

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
occupied all day.” Aleesha stated, “Kids should be able to take advantage of what’s available,
but they can’t because of the restrictions.”
Monique communicated that she had been frustrated and angry because her child was
taken outdoors when she had asked volunteers not to do so. Monique explained that her daughter
had allergies and the volunteers would take her outside anyway. Monique had noticed that her
daughter had difficulty breathing at night after she had played in the grass outside. She stated
that, “They [volunteers] don’t care…and they don’t watch [my child]…not safe for my child to
play here.” Monique and Tasha both communicated that the “volunteers take your child…don’t
even ask if they are ready to go to playroom”, or the volunteers “take some kids to play and don’t
come back to get the rest of the kids.”
Disruption of routines. The mothers conveyed that they believed their play routines were
disrupted while living at the shelter. The mothers explained that a full schedule, a lack of energy,
and shortage of privacy due to shared spaces disturbed play routines they had established prior to
living at the shelter.
Families were required to be out of their bedrooms and working towards self-sufficiency
beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m. each day. These tasks included a wide range of
appointments with health, education, and social service providers. Mothers reported not having
the energy to play with their child the way they would like to, “I’m too tired to play after being
out all day.” Most moms had to rely on the city bus system for transportation. Mothers
communicated that rides on the bus were often long and crowded; and explained that the buses
were not designed with young children in mind (no seatbelts or safety harnesses).
Each mother conveyed that, “We are out of our usual routine here”, and that there was
not enough time, “No real time to do things together…no time to play...not able to watch favorite

75

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
shows together”, and that they were not able to play the way I’d like to with their child due to
rules and shared spaces. Bedrooms were the primary space children and mothers played together.
When discussing where mothers most often played with their children they stated, “We play in
our room upstairs” and, “Her and I usually read a book, or play candy land, or play a game on
my phone in our room…not really a play area up there…just a room with a bed.”
When asked about the evening routines, mothers discussed that bath time was not the
same as it had been prior to living at the shelter. The mothers indicated that bath time had been
an enjoyable play activity that was disrupted when they moved to the shelter. There was one
bathroom with a bathtub; the other two full bathrooms had showers. Mothers reported that their
children had no time to play in the bathtub most days because there were usually other families
waiting to bathe their children. Aleesha explained that her daughter, “likes to play while taking a
bath…she likes to play in the water…here she can’t take the time to play in the tub.” Vanessa
communicated that there was not enough time, nor did she have the energy after a busy day to
allow her son to play while taking a bath.
Mothers reported that they were, “Not allowed to play with my child in the playroom”.
Several mothers explained that they enjoyed joining their child in playing with toys, but related
that at the shelter there was, “Not a lot of play going on here.” Starr stated that her daughter,
“plays anywhere she can get a chance.” When asked about play upstairs (where bedrooms are
located) Starr added that her daughter “runs around, climbs up and down on the bed…looks at
some books by herself… and plays with little toys…little balls and stuffed soft animals we
brought with us.” Starr indicated that it would be helpful if there were other areas in the home for
children to play in.

76

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Findings indicated mothers’ perceived play to be an important activity for children as
well as mothers. Mothers reported the social dynamics and physical characteristics of the shelter
more often constrained rather than facilitated play. Findings also revealed that mothers, staff, and
volunteers’ defined play as an activity that children needed to engage in, and that play is “doing
what kids do.”
Mothers, shelter staff and volunteers perceived play as an activity that enabled children
and mothers an opportunity to be free from the stress of adult problems. Starr and Aleesha
communicated that play was a time for “moms to have a break.” Mothers understood that play
had the potential to foster healthy physiological growth and facilitate cognitive development, and
psychological well-being. Mothers, shelter staff and volunteers expressed that during play
children, “explore…learn different things…learn ways of playing…work out crazy stuff they
couldn’t make sense of.” Mothers conveyed that they felt good when they knew their children
were able to play. Tasha explained that, “It [play] makes me feel good inside…I feel happy
because I know she’s enjoying herself [when she is playing].” Mothers reported that the social
dynamics and physical environment of the shelter offered potential for play experiences. The
mothers perceived the physical spaces, and the play materials and equipment as having potential
to stimulate children’s growth and development, and mitigate stress and anxiety in both children
and mothers. Mothers explained that the playroom full of toys and the large playground space
were characteristics that they appreciated, stating that, “there is a lot for them to do [in the
playroom]…a lot of options to play…more space for kids to run around outside…kids can run,
play outside and get fresh air.” Mothers also stated that their child enjoyed playing with the other
children at the shelter. Vanessa pointed out that the, “kids are better behaved here than kids at
home.”

77

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
During interviews, mothers stated that rather than support healthy play, the contextual
nature of the shelter often acted as a barrier. Mothers reported that availability of shelter play
spaces, materials, and equipment was restricted by program rules enforced by shelter staff and
volunteers. Each of the mothers conveyed that they were not permitted to play with or watch
their child at play in the shelter playroom. The mothers stated they did not understand why they
were not permitted to play with their children or observe their children at play in the playroom
and that they would appreciate opportunities to take their child to the playroom. Monique stated,
“It would be nice if I could see her when she plays.” Shelter staff and volunteers reported that the
sole purpose of the playroom was to provide a space for childcare while mothers attended a
class. Children were permitted to play in the playroom between 7:00 and 8:00 pm Monday
through Thursday each week with a shelter volunteer. Shelter staff and volunteers reported that
the purpose of the playroom was to provide a space for childcare so mothers could attend the
mandatory life skills classes four nights each week. The mothers did not understand why they
were prohibited from playing with their children or observing children’s play in the playroom.
Aleesha stated, “I don’t understand why parents can’t take their kids to the playroom.” Starr
commented that, “It’s bull” that we can’t take our children to the playroom.
There was a tangible sense of loss and uncertainty when mothers described play
experiences at the shelter. The loss of play interactions between child and mother were perceived
by mothers as lost opportunities for both the children and themselves to build capacity as a
parent and to strengthen mother-child bonding. Mothers associated watching children play and
playing with their children to a sense of being “happy and feeling good inside.” Lacking the
time, opportunity, and energy to play with or observe children at play, were viewed by mothers
as lost opportunities to feel positive about themselves, their children, and their situation. Mothers

78

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
were uncertain as to when they would be able to see their child play or when they would have the
time or energy to play “pretend, tickle, chase, or watch a cartoon, or read” with their child.
Mothers, shelter staff and volunteers indicated that each day was scheduled with mandatory
wake and bedtimes, meals and chores, classes and case manager meetings, and appointments
with health, education, employment, or human services providers.
Mothers reported a lack of opportunities to engage in important family rituals such as
playing with toys, or “playing in the tub” or “watching favorite shows” with children. Tasha
communicated that she was not aware the mothers were permitted to take children to play on the
shelter playground. Tasha stated that she didn’t take her child outside to play on the playground
because she thought, “kids were only allowed there with a volunteer.” She expressed wanting to
play on the playground with her daughter, however she was fearful that in doing so she would be
“breaking the rules” and risk being evicted from the shelter.
The mothers indicated that existing levels of family stress were compounded by the
restrictive factors associated with the shelter. Mothers described feeling as if they were always
on alert, explaining that, “It’s hard here…We have to keep them [children] out of
everything…have to keep kids quiet so you don’t get into trouble… [we are] out of our usual
routine here…doesn’t give us a break when kids can only go in the playroom with the volunteer”
while mothers are in class.
Mothers’ conceptual understanding of play within the context of the shelter was grounded
in their individual memories of play. Thus, perceptions of play at the shelter were steeped in the
memories of their past childhood play experiences and the more recent memories of play with
their own children prior to living at the shelter. Interview questions and the photo elicitation
interview process aided in eliciting the memories of mothers’ past play experiences as well as

79

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
current perceptions of play. Interview probes and prompts were focused on mothers’ perceptions
of play in general, their past play experiences, and in particular, on their constructed
understanding of the nature of play at the shelter. This reflective process led to the identification
of the positive and negative attributes mothers associated with play in the shelter. Because
memories of play were an influential factor in mothers’ perceptions of play at the shelter, they
will be clarified to properly situate the findings. This next section details mothers’ play
memories garnered from the individual semi-structured interviews with the six mothers
participating in the study.
Overall, mothers perceived that the shelter playroom and playground were environments
that offered larger spaces to play in, as well as more toys, and equipment to play with than were
available in previous living situations. One mother explained that the shelter playroom,
playground, and home in general were safer for her children than a previous residence because
there wasn’t harmful “stuff everywhere”. Another mother stated that play at the shelter was not
safe for her daughter due to a lack of childproofing in the playroom and appropriate supervision
by volunteers in the playroom and on the playground.
Additional findings
Potential strategies for enhancing play opportunities at the shelter were also revealed
during data analysis. Starr, Tasha, Colette, and Aleesha communicated ideas for improving the
play experiences at the shelter. Findings from interviews and field notes of informal
conversations with the four mothers revealed five strategies they perceived could act to minimize
barriers and maximize supportive factors pertaining to play at the shelter. The strategies stemmed
from what mothers reported as being positive aspects of the shelter. The suggested strategies
included: (1) Allowing mothers to use the playroom with their children, (2) Permitting mothers

80

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
to observe children playing in the playroom, (3) Expanding playroom availability to include the
weekdays and weekends, (4) Decreasing the number of toys and materials in the playroom, and
(5) Ensuring that rules pertaining to playground use were clearly communicated to each mother.
Summary
To summarize, this chapter provided a discussion of mothers’ perceptions of play in the
context of an emergency homeless shelter for women and children. Mothers shared their
understanding of play at the shelter via discussions with the researcher with regard to their
current play experiences and also play experiences prior to living at the shelter. Mothers’ play
perceptions were grounded in memories from their own childhood play, past play experiences
with their child prior to the shelter, and lived experiences of play at the shelter. Perceptions of
play were framed within an overarching concern for child safety.
The two themes and four subthemes depict the essence of the meanings mothers
attributed to perceptions of play at the shelter. Play was considered as an important aspect in the
lives of both the children and mothers. Play was perceived as an activity that could foster healthy
growth and development, and offer respite and sense of freedom from daily stress. Furthermore,
play was associated with a sense of uncertainty and lost opportunities to interact with and
observe children engaging in play activities.
Mothers reported feeling happy about the concept of play in general. They believed being
able to play with their child and also watching their child play instilled a sense of wellbeing and
helped them to feel less stressed by their situation. Mothers also related feeling frustrated and at
times angry about the rules governing the time, spaces, and resources associated with play at the
shelter. Additionally, mothers described five recommendations for improving the play
experiences of families residing at the shelter.

81

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
The following chapter is a discussion of the study findings, conclusions, and
implications. Potential strategies and initiatives used to enhance policy and practice within
homeless services program and organizational levels will be discussed. Recommendations for
future research in the field of homeless services delivery systems will be addressed.
Chapter 5
Summary, Implications, and Recommendations
In spite of the plethora of research findings pointing to the vital role play serves in early
childhood development, study of contextual factors impacting opportunities to play is absent
from the available literature of play and children and families experiencing homelessness. Thus,
to begin to piece together a descriptive narrative of the nature of children’s play in a homeless
shelter, this researcher explored mothers’ perceptions of young children’s play in the context of a
local urban core emergency homeless shelter for women and children.
The words of Swick (2004), Buckner (2008), and Kilmer, Cook, Crusto, Strater, and
Haber (2012) served as catalysts for this study. In his 2004 article, Swick stated that by
acknowledging the unique strengths and challenges, early childhood and human services
stakeholders could more effectively serve the needs of children and families experiencing
homelessness, that, “By understanding the dynamics of what homeless families experience, we
can be more responsive to the challenges impeding their function.” (p. 120). Four years later
Buckner posited that the study of family homelessness should be informed by a bio-ecological
approach, relating that, “Shelter conditions are probably an especially important factor in
moderating the impacts of homelessness for a child…there are important qualities of shelters that
may worsen or buffer a child’s experience while living there.” (2008, p. 731). Kilmer, Cook,
Crusto, Strater, and Haber argued for a more concerted effort within the field of homeless

82

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
services to, “target those influences that carry particular weight in the development and
adaptation of youngsters.” (2012, p. 392).
The medium of play within the context of homeless shelters for women and children is a
topic deserving of exploration and further understanding. Furthermore, if homeless services
programs and systems are to effectively meet the complex needs of families experiencing
homelessness, then play must also be included. Researchers must endeavor to uncover the
dynamic and contextual factors associated with play at homeless shelters. In answer to the
research question, How is play perceived by mothers experiencing homelessness in the context of
a residential homeless shelter for women and children, this study’s focus on six mothers and
their seven children under the age of 5 provides indications of mitigating factors of supportive
nurturing play experiences.
This chapter includes a summary of the exploratory case study, an analysis and synthesis
of findings, description of study limitations, and a discussion of implications regarding policy
and practice at the program and systems levels. Suggestions for future research are also
discussed.
Summary
The purpose of the study was to explore the contextual nature of play as it was
experienced by the families residing in an urban homeless shelter located in the Midwest of the
United States. The rationale for this study was supported by well-established research findings
linking early play experiences to trajectories of healthy growth and development, and knowledge
of an existing gap in the literature of play and young children experiencing homelessness.
The central focus of this study was young children’s play in a homeless shelter. Mothers’
perceptions of play in the context of a homeless shelter were explored based on the

83

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
understanding that play during early childhood is a crucial mechanism for early cognitive, social,
emotional, and physical development. Themes rooted in the data clearly depict mothers
perceptions of both the positive and negative attributes associated with play experiences at the
shelter. Starr stated that, “children will play anywhere with anything…and they should be
allowed to play.” One mother’s statement supported the finding that play was important for
mothers and children. She summed up the importance of play, stating, “kids need to be able to
have fun…and that moms should take some time out to play with kids.” Another mother
expressed that after a busy day it felt good to see her daughter playing and having fun; it helped
this mother to feel a sense of peace and happiness in spite of her circumstances. Play facilitated
overall growth and development. Mothers related that there were more opportunities for children
to play outdoors with peers and the potential to challenge them physically on the playground.
The theme of loss an uncertainty stemmed from mothers expressions of not being able to play
with their child in the playroom or to observe their child play in the playroom or on the
playground. Aleesha explained that, “We have to clean up the playroom, but can’t take our kids
there…parents should be allowed to take their kids to the playroom.” However, in striving to see
the positive side of the situation, Aleesha expressed that at least the children had a place to play,
even if it was with a volunteer and wasn’t with their mothers.
Findings indicated that decreases in stress and anxiety were experienced by mothers
during supportive play interactions with children, and also when observing children at play. This
finding aligns with Milteer and Ginsburg’s (2012) position stating that play serves an important
role as a protective factor for early adversity. Mothers reported feeling “good inside” when
playing, for example, a game of pretend or bath tub play. Mothers also stated that when seeing
and hearing their children at play they experience feelings of joy and happiness. The mothers

84

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
realized that, “kids are transitioning [to shelter life] too” and believed it was important for mental
and physical health to be able to play, “the way they need to play”. Knowing that children could,
“feel free without a care in the world...that kids could feel like kids again and be themselves”
during play, helped to alleviate some of the guilt and anxiety mothers reported being conscious
of while in the shelter. Being able to relax and attend to children’s needs during play interactions
provided opportunities for mothers to more fully support the emotional needs of their child. This
finding indicated that play in this sense was a crucial component of mental health and overall
wellbeing for families experiencing homelessness.
Finding from the literature suggested that families experiencing homelessness experience
the loss of their home, social supports, sense of safety, and capacity to meet the emotional needs
of their children, leaving them feeling discouraged and frustrated (Buckner, 2008; Smolen,
2013). Mothers in this study reported similar lamentations. Many of the play routines, such as
bath tub play, rough and tumble play, and games involving physical activity indoors (e.g.,
running, climbing stairs) were constrained by the crowded environment and therefore not
tolerated at the shelter. The fact that mothers were unable to support the types of play
experiences they knew children needed and enjoyed, increased the already high levels of stress
they experienced, and served to diminish mothers’ sense of control and capacity to affect
positive changes in their situation.
Analysis and Synthesis of Findings
Each of the six mothers participating in this study expressed their appreciation for having
a place to stay, access to food, and a place where their children could play. Two mothers reported
that they were thankful for having a daily routine to follow. The mothers explained that although
the routine restricted play, they believed the routine would provide them with a model to use

85

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
when they secured a place of their own. The mothers acknowledged the potential of the context
of the shelter for facilitating play. The amount and variety of toys and the playground equipment
and space were perceived by mothers as characteristics of shelter which afforded opportunities
for positive play experiences for their children.
Findings from this study aligned with findings from the literature suggesting that shelter
environments often lack resources necessary to appropriately meet the needs of families and
children experiencing homelessness (Buckner, 2008; Harms, Ray, & Rolandelli, 1998; Swick &
Williams, 2006). Literature findings indicated that young children experiencing homelessness
tend to be burdened with more exposure to stress and barriers to supportive resources than stably
housed children with a similar economic position (Masten, Miliotis, Graham-Bermann, Ramirez,
&Neemann, 1993). This study’s findings suggested that opportunities for appropriate,
stimulating play interactions were limited due to the ecological nature of the homeless shelter.
Shelter rules acted as barriers impeding access to the positive psychological benefits of play,
such as stress reduction and facilitation of strengthening child-parent bonds.
The restrictive context of the shared spaces, the lack of appropriate play resources, and
strictly enforced rules governing the access and availability of the playroom worked in concert to
constrain rather than facilitate opportunities for quality play interactions. Shelter rules designed
to ensure a safe and controlled environment acted to disrupt family routines. This description of
shelters as controlled environments was reiterated in the literature (Buckner, 2008; Smolen,
2013). Smolen (2013) described family homelessness as an experience of losing a place of
sanctuary; that homelessness diminishes a mothers’ sense of control, safety, and choices
generally attributed with living in a place of your own. Mothers in this study reported that shelter
rules diminished their child’s play experiences. Mothers feared being evicted due to non-

86

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
compliance of rules if they did not restrict their child’s play behaviors. This fear inhibited
mothers’ capacity to support their child’s need for stimulating active play.
The rule prohibiting mothers from playing with and observing children play in the
playroom left the mothers in this study feeling frustrated and uncertain about children’s play in
the playroom with the volunteers. Mothers’ sense of uncertainty in relation to children’s play
was not indicated in findings from literature.
Mothers discussed play at the shelter in relation to concerns for their child’s safety. One
mother was fearful her daughter would injure herself at the shelter. Another mother was
concerned with the lack of appropriate child supervision by volunteers in the playroom as well as
on the playground. The issue of safety was also communicated in the literature. To bolster
parent-child relationships, Swick (2008) spoke of the necessity for “crafting a nurturing
environment” (p. 149). The author discussed the importance of creating an environment that
provided children and families experiencing homelessness with a sense of safety, nurturance, and
consistent support.
The phrase “it’s hard here” was conveyed by several mother in this study. The mothers
perceived factors such as the strict daily schedule, shortage of time, lack of energy, and the
constraining nature of shared spaces made life at the shelter challenging and thereby
compounding existing levels of stress. This same phrase was reiterated in the findings of Averitt
(2003). Averitt examined the impact of homelessness on parenting capacity. The author focused
on the lived experiences of women with preschool age children living at two homeless shelters.
Averitt reported the overarching theme, “It’s hard!” surfaced from the data garnered from the
mothers she interviewed (2003, p. 87).

87

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Mothers’ statements about children needing to play so they could feel free of adult
problems and feel like a normal child aligned with Harms, Ray, and Rolandelli’s statement that,
“Play…permits children to become completely absorbed in their own activities or fantasies and
leave their worries behind for a time” (1998, p.49). Mothers in this study understood that
children needed to play, stating that play was, “what kids do”. Mothers also related that play
could evoke a sense of happiness and joy in the children as well as the mothers at the shelter.
Trauma and stress associated with family homelessness often depletes parents’ capacity
to effectively provide children the support required for optimal development (Buckner, 2008;
Swick & Williams, 2006; Masten, 2001). Mothers in this study expressed that the structured
daily routine, shelter rules regarding the playroom, staff expectations pertaining to child behavior
and supervision, and mothers lack of energy and time disrupted typical play routines, such as
play during bath time, and prohibited mothers from experiencing play activities with their child
in a manner they deemed most appropriate.
Description of Limitations
Limitations and Delimitations Related to Methodology. This research study had
limitations and delimitations. Limitations are external aspects restricting the scope of the study.
This research utilized a single case study design and therefore findings were bound to mothers’
perceptions of play as it existed at the single shelter where the study took place. Findings from
this exploratory case study were not intended to be generalizable. However, transfer of
knowledge gained from this study may be utilized to inform understanding of play within similar
contexts. To broaden the scope of this research, future investigations should endeavor to broaden
the scope of research to include multiple-case study design, conducting cross-case and within
case analyses.

88

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Delimitations are study constraints imposed by the researcher to intentionally control the
parameters of the study. One such delimitation of this study was the sole use of adult
participants. The study participants consisted of mothers, shelter staff, and volunteers and
therefore findings and conclusions are based on the researcher’s interpretations of those
particular perspectives.
Including children in the study would have enabled the researcher to, “seek to understand
children’s experiences through their words, images, and actions” (Freeman & Mathison, 2009, p.
15). Gathering children’s constructed perspectives of homelessness could serve to extend the
conceptualization of the ecology of play in this context, thus providing data used to inform and
enhance services (Swick, 2010). Understanding homelessness through the eyes of a child could
reveal information beyond what can be gained via studies with adults; particularly the existence
of inherent supports and constraints for early development within shelter care.
The researcher was the primary instrument for data collection and analysis. To bracket
cultural bias the researcher kept a journal which was separate from field notes and other study
data. The journal provided the researcher opportunities to intentionally acknowledge and reflect
on the nature of personal impressions and interpretations of events.
Another limitation of the study pertained to the photo elicitation process. The study was
designed to have mothers take the photographs to be used in the photo elicitation group
interview. However, mothers chose not to take photographs, and instead requested that I take the
photographs. Follow-up conversations revealed that mothers chose not to take photographs
because they did not wish to have one more responsibility added to their lives, and also because
they believed they would not be able take quality photos. Tasha stated that she, “didn’t think
[she] could take good pictures… didn’t want to have to think about using a camera and taking

89

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
pictures.” Colette offered similar responses when asked why she chose not to take photographs
of her daughter. Colette related two reasons: the first was that she didn’t want to use a camera or
her phone to take photographs because she thought the researcher should take them “since they
were for a research project”; and secondly, she didn’t want to “deal with a camera or taking
pictures”. In future studies utilizing a photo elicitation method, offering participants a brief
hands-on experience with a camera would foster confidence in mothers’ efficacy of camera use.
Each mother expressed that they did appreciate receiving the photo album containing the pictures
they chose of their child. Starr reported that the photo album was the only set of pictures she
possessed of her children.
Discussion of Implications
The shelter environment was designed to serve the immediate needs of the women and
children seeking services there. The shelter staff provided families with a safe place to sleep,
food, capacity building classes, and connections to community supports. To keep children safe
from injury, the staff and volunteers established and maintained order by ensuring the children
did not engage in disruptive or destructive behaviors. To ensure everyone’s safety, the staff and
volunteers stringently enforced rules, restricted the use of all spaces inside and outside the home,
and closely monitored and controlled all aspects of shelter activities.
Mothers in this study wanted their children to be able to play more and be less confined,
contained, and controlled by the staff, volunteers, and other mothers at the shelter. Mothers
believed their children should be free to behave like typical children. The mothers held the
conviction that their children should be permitted to play at the shelter as though it were their
home. Mothers knew that during play children had the opportunity to be “normal”, to be free
from the anxiety and stress stemming from homelessness and poverty. Mothers wanted above all

90

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
else to secure a safe residence where they could live and care for their children. The study
findings have implications for existing shelter rules and social dynamics. Affording mothers and
children more freedom of choice and less top-down control might foster mothers’ sense of
confidence and capacity as an effective parent and could serve to ease the staff’s burden of
behavior management.
Improved play experiences would not only directly benefit the families and children in
homeless shelters, quality play experiences for the children and mothers could actually
mitigate the tension and stress experienced by shelter staff and volunteers as well. At times the
level of tension and stress at the shelter was explicitly visible between the mothers and staff—it
was so heavy it was nearly palatable. Enhanced play interactions could evoke a more positive
shelter environment which in turn would benefit everyone involved.
Findings from this exploratory case study may be utilized as a catalyst to spark future
studies of family homelessness. Findings from such studies may serve to inform the
development of frameworks for policy, practices and funding initiatives used to improve
outcomes for young children and families experiencing homelessness.
It must be noted however, to address the issue of play in the context of homelessness,
researchers must broaden the scope of investigation so that it includes the study of not only
individual programs but must also include the systems of services for homeless children and
families. Sustainable efforts to improve the quality of play for families and children experiencing
homelessness needs to occur at a systemic level. Findings from studies conducted at an
organizational level can be utilized to inform initiatives for positive changes made within
homeless services systems nationally. Comprehensive models of service delivery have the
potential to address disparities in access to quality play environments within homeless shelter

91

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
systems, thus warrant further examination (Cosgrove & Norris-Shortle, 2015; Bassuk, & Olivet,
2010; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; Wilson & Squires, 2014).
Suggestions for Future Research
Future research focused on need specific services for families (e.g., survivors of domestic
violence, substance abuse treatment, supports for young children and youth) can uncover
strengths and challenges to effective care inherent at an organizational level. Further studies can
also be used to inform policy and practice at the systems level, for example within education,
health, and human services delivery systems. Findings could then serve to initiate a more holistic
approach to meeting the unique needs of families and young children experiencing
homelessness.
Recommendations. To initiate translational approaches regarding the issues of child and
family homelessness and play, two areas of research are warranted: (1) In-depth research of
mediating factors associated with the ecology of play in the homeless services system, and (2)
Further exploration of existing service delivery programs firmly grounded in evidenced
supported, play-based, “family-directed, culturally affirming, and trauma-informed” approaches
(Garrett-Akinsanya, 2014, p. 145). Play-based service delivery models and initiatives to utilize
playworkers in shelters exist and could address the specific play needs of families and children
within the homeless services system. (Cosgrove & Norris-Shortle, 2015; Guarino & Bassuk,
2010; Prescott, Soares, Konnath, & Bassuk, 2008; United States Department of Health and
Human Services, 2014; Wilson & Squires, 2014).
To summarize, the body of research centered on family homelessness is less than
comprehensive. Families experiencing homelessness can best be served by empirical
investigations of mitigating factors associated with nurturing mother-child interactions. Research

92

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
findings, then, could inform policy and practice of homeless services programs and enhance
outcomes for children and families most at risk.
Conclusion
Families with young children are a large segment of the homeless population in the
United States. The unique needs of families and children experiencing homelessness have yet to
be fully addressed by existing research.
During the early years of life a child’s experiences in the social environment influence
neural pathway formation and establish foundational cognitive, social, emotional, and physical
development linked to later life outcomes. Healthy growth and development are mediated by
strong caregiver-child attachments and stimulating supportive play experiences. Homeless
shelters are often environments with limited opportunities for young children and families to
experience quality play interactions. Therefore children and families most at risk of negative life
outcomes are denied access to a primary medium capable of ameliorating negative impacts
associated with homelessness.
Information gathered from ecologically based research, such as this study, can increase
understanding of factors constraining as well as facilitating quality play in homeless shelters.
Implications for the study of young children’s play within homeless service organizations are
considerably far reaching and cannot be ignored. Findings from research of the contextual nature
of play in shelters can serve to shape policy and practice at various levels of service delivery
systems. Shelters are in a unique position to effectively serve the varied and complex needs of
families experiencing homelessness. Shelters have the potential to provide families with
environments purposefully designed to facilitate healthy play experiences, foster strong motherchild bonds, and support children’s healthy growth and development.

93

PLAY AND HOMELESSNESS
Mothers experiencing homelessness need the affordance of time. In addition, they need
the support from family-centered trauma-informed service providers to build capacity. Mothers
need to build capacity not only as self-sufficient adults, but to strengthen their role as competent,
confident and playful parents. Homeless shelter programs are situated in a position to act as
vehicles to support this role. Further research of the issue of play and homeless services delivery
systems must be advocated for and pursued in an effort to break down the barriers and strengthen
supports to appropriate play experiences in family shelters. Future research of evidenced based
policies and practices, such as those found in existing programs utilizing frameworks of playbased trauma informed care is recommended.
In conclusion, due to the vast numbers of families with young children seeking refuge in
homeless shelters, implications of this area of research are timely and deserve attention. The time
for creating positive change in the lives of families and young children experiencing
homelessness is now. Play can no longer be overlooked if we as a society are to create
comprehensive service delivery models with the capacity to effectively meet the unique needs of
families and children experiencing homelessness.

45 CRF § 46.102(f): Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator
(whether professional or student) conducting research obtains:
data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
identifiable private information.
Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example,
venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed
for research purposes.
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and
subject.
Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an
individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and
information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the
individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical
record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject
