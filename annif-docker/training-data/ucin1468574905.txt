Abstract
Young Jo Lee (b. 1943) is considered one of the leading contemporary composers in
Korea. Throughout his prolific career, he has imbued his music with a distinctive cultural
identity, absorbing new techniques from the West while maintaining his indigenous roots.
This document focuses on Lee’s Doori Nori for Violin and Piano (1995), Sesi Nori for Violin,
Cello, and Piano (2002), and Honza Nori for Piano (2010). I approach these works from the
perspective of an interpretive performer, discussing how Lee merges the idioms of traditional
Korean music with contemporary Western musical language, and considering several musical
and technical issues arising in performance. This study will give the performer a guide to
appreciating Lee’s stylistically integrated compositions.

Introduction
Young Jo Lee is one of the most influential composers adapting characteristics of
Korean traditional music into contemporary musical languages. Although he studied Western
music, he has always emphasized his national identity as a Korean composer. His synthesis of
the two musical cultures is highly influential, encouraging Korean musicians to bring the
Korean spirit to the world through appreciating and performing Korean music.1 Most of his
numerous works for keyboard have been commissioned by well-known Korean pianists; they
are frequently performed in concert, and have been well received by audiences.

Purpose of the Study
This document will examine the stylistic features of Lee’s piano works written in the
past two decades from a specifically pianistic perspective, bringing them to the attention of
today’s performers; I will focus on Doori Nori for Violin and Piano (1995), Sesi Nori for
Violin, Cello, and Piano (2002), and Honza Nori for Piano (2010), as they exemplify Lee’s
synthesis of Korean and Western musical styles.2 I will first identify the major elements of
Korean traditional music found in these pieces; I will then determine how Lee develops these
materials through Western compositional techniques and instruments. Finally, I will discuss
issues in performing these works.

Literature Review
A variety of books, articles, and theses have been published about Young Jo Lee,

Nori means “playing”; Honza, Doori, and Sesi are “alone,” “two,” and “three,” respectively. Unless

including many collections of essays by the composer himself. There also exists a large body
of literature on aspects of traditional and contemporary music in Korea.
I draw on two books for the composer’s biographical background and musical
characteristics. In his autobiography, Resume Written on a Music Sheet: Composer Young Jo
Lee, Lee goes into detail about his musical family; education and career in Korea, Germany,
and the United States; and compositional style.3 Jung Soo Hong, the first president of the
Korean-German Musicology Society, and three of his students recently published The Music
of Young Jo Lee. In this book, they consider Lee’s educational background and musical
characteristics; they include a list of compositions and the composer’s discography as well.4
Detailed research on Korean percussion music, samulnori, can be found in books by
two renowned ethnomusicologists: Keith Howard, a professor of music at the University of
London, and Nathan Hesselink, a professor of ethnomusicology at the University of British
Columbia.5 In addition to describing the historical background and traditional and
contemporary elements of Korean music, their particular interest in samulnori contribute to a
deep understanding about the genre; this is useful in the present study as the three Nori works
discussed here share many characteristics with samulnori.6

Choon Mee Kim’s article, “A Study on the Structural Thinking in the Music of the
Composer: Young-Jo Lee,” offers a thorough background on Lee’s music, and specifically
addresses detailed interpretations of his major works.7 Here, Kim notes how Lee utilizes
traditional Korean elements in the compositions, and emphasizes how to compose, perform,
and respect Korean music in a globalized world.8 The program notes to the listed recordings
of the Nori works, written by the composer himself, present the overall ideas and distinctive
characteristics of the compositions.9 A review of the recordings by Jack Sullivan contains
further commentary on the main features of the pieces, notably regarding the blending of
musical aspects from the East and West.10
A few documents have been written about Lee’s solo piano compositions; they
mostly provide theoretical analyses and consider his stylistic features. Sung Bok Gu-Jang11
and Kunwoo Kim12 each provide general discussion of Lee’s borrowings from Korean
traditional and Western classical music and his attempts to integrate them. Likewise, in

Kim chiefly considers how the composer incorporates Korean traditional elements with
Western musical ideas.13 While valuable for understanding Lee’s broad compositional
principles, these studies do not provide practical suggestions for the pianist interested in
performing this music.
YeonJin Kim’s document, “The Musical Style and Compositional Technique of
Young-Jo Lee, As Reflected in his Violin Compositions Honza Nori for Solo Violin and
Doori Nori for Violin and Piano,” involves more consideration of performance matters,
particularly referring to Korean traditional stringed instruments and techniques, such as
gayageum, geomungo, and haegeum, that are used in those works to create a unique Korean
sound with glissando or pizzicato on the violin.14
Most of these studies are limited by their omission of the performance dimension.
Furthermore, no studies exist that consider Lee’s Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano. By
evaluating these three Nori works for piano, my study will help to provide a comprehensive
understanding of Lee’s musical language in reference to piano performance practices.

Methodology
This document examines the stylistic features of Young Jo Lee’s Honza Nori for
Piano, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, and Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano. My
methodology will blend a style study with discussion of performance practice. I will take a
performance perspective on Lee’s use of traditional Korean musical materials through

Western compositional techniques and instruments, and indicate problems that pianists may
face in performing these works.
This document will have four chapters. Chapter 1 will include a biographical sketch
of Lee’s life, career, and overall compositional style. Chapter 2 will trace the development of
traditional and contemporary Korean music from a historical perspective by considering the
three generations of composers and the elements of Korean traditional music. Chapter 3 will
be devoted to the background of Lee’s Nori compositions for piano and detailed stylistic
examination of each piece, with interpretative suggestions for their performance. Chapter 4
will further consider how Lee infuses Korean traditional elements into Western compositional
techniques to create his signature musical expressions. A list of Lee’s works, an interview
with the composer, and the letter of copyright permissions will be included in the appendices.

Chapter 1
Young Jo Lee: Musical Influences and Journey
Young Jo Lee
Young Jo Lee was born in Seoul, Korea on April 17, 1943, into a musical family. His
father, Heung Ryul Lee (1909-1980), is considered one of the best composers of art song in
Korea, writing over four hundred works for voice and piano.1 Lee’s brothers and sisters also
studied music; his youngest brother, Young Soo Lee (b. 1951), whose musical talents he
always admired, is currently a professor of composition at Yeungnam University.2 In his
early years, Lee’s father encouraged him to enjoy music, teaching him piano and the history
and theory of Western music. Lee then began to study composition and harmony with his
father’s closest friend, Dong Jin Kim (1913-2009).3
Lee entered Yonsei University in Seoul, where he earned a B.M. in 1968 and a M.M.
in 1970; he studied composition with Un-Yung La (1922-1993), whose incorporation of
Korean folk elements into twentieth-century Western harmonies raised possibilities of a new
style; this approach had a decisive influence on Lee’s compositional language.4 During his
college years, Lee also studied the piri (Korean double reed instrument) with Jae-guk Jeong

1

Lee, Resume Written on a Music Sheet, 27; later, Lee composed many pieces based on themes from
his father’s art songs, such as Baugogae (Rock hill) Variations for Piano in the Composition Style of Bach,
Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, Bartok, Webern, Messiaen, and Young Jo Lee on a Theme by Heung Ryul Lee
(1983); Mother’s Heart Variations for Piano on a Theme by Heung Ryul Lee (2011); and Sumjip Agie (Island
Lullaby) Variations for Piano on a Theme by Heung Ryul Lee (2014). See Appendix A: Selected List of
Compositions by Young Jo Lee.

Ibid., 283-290; in addition, Lee’s son, Charles Lee, is a composer, principal cellist of the Boulder
Philharmonic Orchestra, and an instructor of cello at Metropolitan State University of Denver.

Ibid., 52; among the first generation of Korean composers, Kim is beloved by many Koreans for art
songs expressing national sentiments, including his representative song, Gagopa (I wish to go).
4

Ibid., 63; Un-Yung La, a Korean composer, dedicated himself to the reformation of Korean musical
language. He composed approximately 1,500 works, frequently lectured at universities, and published a series of
textbooks on music theory in addition to collections of essays and criticism.

(b. 1942), inspiring his use of traditional Korean elements in his compositions.5 Lee had an
opportunity to perform the piri with the Yonsei Concert Choir when they toured Japan in
1968.6 Based on his learning and performing experiences with the piri, he wrote Concerto
for Piri and Orchestra, which was dedicated to Jeong.7 Lee also became deeply interested in
choral music during his time with Yonsei Concert Choir, and composed the Kyung (Monk’s
Chorus) for the men’s chorus for his master’s degree recital in 1975. When Lee visited a
Buddhist temple in his childhood, he was captivated by the sound of reading Buddhist
scriptures and the timbre of temple gongs and blocks.8 Lee tried to combine Korean Buddhist
and Western music in the Kyung, employing traditional Korean rhythms and folk tunes,
imitating the sound of traditional Buddhist percussion, and using Western twentieth-century
compositional techniques such as tone clusters, twelve-tone serialism, and pointillism.9
Lee moved to Munich, Germany to study with Carl Orff (1895-1982) and Wilhelm
Killmayer (b. 1927) at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater from 1977 to 1980. Orff was
impressed with Kyung, and its use of Korean traditional elements.10 However, Lee was able
to study with Carl Orff just for a year due to Orff’s health issues; Lee then continued his

studies under Killmayer, the chair of the department of composition.11 For his graduate
recital in 1979, Lee composed Sori No. 3 for Clarinet, which was published by Otto Heinrich
Noetzel Verlag in Wilhelmshaven, Germany in 1982.12 Kyung and Sori No. 3 for Clarinet are
considered the most significant works leading up to his integrated compositional style.
Lee continued his doctoral studies with Jack C. Goode (1921-2002), who was a
student of Arnold Schoenberg, at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago in 1986.13
During this time, he paved the way toward his mature style, developing a complex,
stylistically varied musical language. His first opera, Tcheo Yong, was commissioned by the
Korea National Opera and premiered in 1987. Incorporating the Korean legend of the ancient
god Tcheo Yong, traditional pentatonic modes, and unique Korean rhythmic patterns,14 this
was the first successful opera to blend Korean tradition with the means of Western music. The
opera was favorably reviewed in the United States and Korea.15

Career
Lee’s honors in composition include the Chicago New Music Award, Korean
Composers Association Award, Korean Association of Art Critics Awards, and most recently,

the Nanpa Music Award in 2015.16 He has been invited to many international music festivals
and concerts. Lee traveled to Budapest, Amsterdam, and Wurzburg to work for the New
Music Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music (ISCM) as a guest
composer. He also served as a composer in residence at the Maastricht New Music Festival in
the Netherlands and the 26th International Contemporary Music Festival in Moscow.17
Lee’s large body of work is characterized by Korean traditional dance rhythms,
instruments, folk tunes, and literary figures. Although Lee is best known for his choral works,
he has written in many major genres, including orchestral works, concerti, chamber music,
operas, art songs, unaccompanied work series for solo instruments, and numerous pieces for
solo piano. Most of his works have been commissioned by well-known Korean choirs,
ensembles, instrumentalists, singers, and orchestras. He himself has categorized his primary
works within three periods: 1970s-80s, mainly vocal works including choral works; 1980s1990s, chamber music; 1990s-2000s, opera and orchestral music.18
Lee has greatly contributed to the contemporary keyboard literature in Korea. His
works for piano are ideally suited for the concert repertoire, taking advantage of the
expressive range of the modern piano. They are diverse in compositional style, rhythm,
meter, texture, and dynamics. Lee regards rhythm as one of the most prominent elements; his
rhythmic devices include not only Korean traditional dance rhythms but also asymmetrical
and varying meters and shifting accents, creating percussive effects and a variety of moods:
drama, excitement, and tension.19 His major compositions for piano can be assigned to three

Lee has extensive teaching experience as a professor of composition at Yonsei
University (1980-86), American Conservatory of Music (1989-1994), and Korean National
University of Arts (1994-2008).21 He has translated several books on music theory into
Korean, including works by Max Reger (1873-1916), Zoltán Kodály (1882-1967), Leopold
Spinner (1906-1980), Leon Stein (1910-2002), and Kent Kennan (1913-2003), introducing
Western compositional styles and techniques to Korean students.22 Lee has served as the
chairman of the board for the Korea Arts and Culture Education Service, a foundation
dedicated to enhancing cultural literacy, creativity, and quality of education, since 2013.

Musical Identity (Syncretism): East meets West
Lee’s music is distinguished by its strong Korean roots mixed with German
theoretical influences. While using Korean traditional melodies, rhythms, and instruments,
Lee also embraces tonal music and twentieth-century harmonies,23 in what he describes as

musical syncretism.24 Thus while Lee favors traditional pentatonic scales, he often develops
melodies and harmonies chromatically. He frequently uses diminished sevenths with added
seconds and augmented sixths, especially French sixths; their successive progressions
without resolution create extreme tonal tension.25 Furthermore, Lee often juxtaposes two or
more harmonic patterns, each tied to the character of a particular key, to create a unique
blending of harmonies. Such techniques elevate the role of timbre in his music, rather than
emphasizing the function of a given chord according to, for instance, a tonal center. In turn,
his percussive use of tone clusters and fast repetitive rhythmic patterns suggest the sound of
Korean traditional percussion: buk (barrel drum), kkwaenggwari (small gong), jing (large
gong), and janggu (hourglass-shaped drum). This inventive approach keeps Lee’s works
popular among both the public and Korean performers.

Chapter 2
Korean Musical Heritage
Three Generations of Korean Composers
The Korean music community has passed through several periods of great changes,
leading contemporary Korean composers to express their national identity through a number
of musical experiments. Western music was introduced in Korea in the late nineteenthcentury by two Western missionaries: Henry Gerhard Appenzeller (1858-1902), a Methodist,
and Horace Grant Underwood (1859-1916), a Presbyterian. During that time, they built
modern educational institutions such as Pai Chai Hakdang (‘School’) and Joseon Christian
College, and disseminated church music and Western tunes through worship services and
music classes.1
The spread of Western music had a profound impact on Korean traditional music.
Moreover, as the nation experienced the turbulence of Japanese Colonial Rule (1910-1945),
Liberation, Division, and the Korean War (1950-1953), Korean music likewise changed, was
adapted, and sometimes abandoned. Notably, a distinction was created between yangak, new
Western music, and gukak, Korean traditional music; emerging from this division, changga—
a new type of song combining melodies from hymns, Western folksongs, and children’s songs
with Korean texts—rapidly achieved popularity among the public.2 Korean composers began

It was officially established as a college in 1895, authorized as a four-year college in 1980, and obtained
university status in 1992. In 1915, Underwood established Joseon Christian College, the predecessor of Yonhee
College. Yonhee merged with Severance and became current Yonsei University in 1957.

to meld Western and traditional composition techniques during the political and economic
instability of the 1970s and the increasing socio-economic growth in the 1980s.
Along with transitioning social conditions, the development of twentieth-century
Korean art music can be traced through three generations of composers. The first generation,
active during the first half of the 1900s, incorporated Western musical elements for the first
time. They believed that Korean traditional music was primitive due to its monophonic
texture and structure; thus, they strove to adopt the harmonized idioms of the West. The most
prominent of these composers are Nanpa Hong (1898-1941), Dong Jin Kim (1913-2009), and
Un-Yung La (1922-1993).3 Called the generation of gagok composers, they were devoted to
the development of this lyrical art song, which is similar to the German lied.4 In 1920, Hong
composed the first gagok, Bongseonhwa (“Garden balsam”), using Western tonal harmonies
and heptatonic scales, rather than traditional pentatonic scales.5 With the gagok firmly
established in the following decades, Kim was committed to expressing the spirit of Korean
in his classical songs, such as Bomiomyeon (“When spring comes,” 1931), Gagopa (“I wish
to go,”1933), and Suseonhwa (“Daffodil,” 1941). Contemporary trends in Western music took
root in Korea in the 1950s; La founded the Korean Contemporary Music Society in 1952,6
and Korea became a member of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in
1956.7 These developments played a significant role to promote and disseminate Korean

Korean society was even more heavily influenced by Western cultures following the
Korean War, and composers became more interested in Western contemporary music. The
second generation, during the 1960s and ‘70s, sought to overcome the limitations of their
predecessors by focusing on instrumental music, rather than the gagok or other vocal works
favored by the first-generation composers.8 Aspiring to internationalization, these young
composers relied more on twentieth-century Western compositional techniques such as
serialism, atonality, electronic idioms, and various avant-garde styles.9 This group is
represented by Chung Gil Kim (1933-2012), Sukhi Kang (b. 1934), and Byung-Dong Paik (b.
1936), all of whom studied with the prominent Korean composer Isang Yun (1917-1995) at
the Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover in Germany and returned to live
and build their musical careers in Korea.10 Sukhi Kang established the Pan Music Festival in
1969 and became president of the Korean section of the ISCM in 1972.11 Both the Pan Music

Howard, introduction to Creating Korean Music, xv; Isang Yun is a Korean-born composer who
spent most of his professional career in Germany. He is one of the most admired world-class composers of
Korean decent, yet his musical expertise is more Western. Although he might be said to belong to the first
generation of Korean composers in terms of chronology, his life and career in Germany and experiences in
Korea set him apart. He studied in West Germany in the 1950s, and began his career there; he aimed to
synthesize East and West by developing Korean musical features through Western instruments and avant-garde
techniques, rather than merely quoting traditional tunes or using traditional instruments. However, the Korean
government kidnapped and imprisoned him for visiting North Korea in the 1960s, leading to political uproar and
ideological conflicts in Korean society. After his release, he went back to West Germany, obtained German
citizenship, and never returned to Korea.

contemporary music around the world.12
The third generation, active beginning in the 1980s, is most notable for their efforts
to combine traditional Korean and Western musical elements, seeking out their musical
identities from historical, nationalistic, and stylistic perspectives. On musical identity, Simon
Frith remarks:
Music constructs our sense of identity through the direct experiences it offers the
body, time and sociability, experiences which enable us to place ourselves in
imaginative cultural narratives.13
During 1980s, composers in this group led a movement to develop Korean identity in their
music. They rejected the previous generation’s compositions as mere imitations of Western
music which had little appeal for audiences as well. Writing in new styles based on Korean
materials, they strove for a national expression while creatively blending traditional and
Western techniques.14 Young Jo Lee (b. 1943), Geonyong Lee (b. 1947), Kyu-Yung Chin (b.
1948), and Byung Eun Yoo (b. 1952) are the best-known of this era.15 These third-generation
composers are still active and teach at universities, while their compositions are frequently
performed in numerous concerts and festivals.

Elements of Korean Traditional Music
Korea has developed its own musical culture through five thousand years of history,
maintaining cultural exchange with its neighbors including China and Japan, and actively
adopting Western civilization. From a historical perspective, Korean music can be
categorized into seven distinct periods, based on its political changes: Proto-Three Kingdoms
of Korea to Three Kingdoms Period, about 100 B.C.-660 A.D.; Unified Silla Period, 668-935;
Goryeo Dynasty, 935-1392; Early Joseon Dynasty, 1392-1592; Late Joseon Dynasty, 15921894; Modern Period, 1894-1945; and Contemporary Period, 1945-present.16 An
examination of the elements of Korean traditional music will help to understand how Lee
manipulates them in the three Nori compositions for piano considered in this document.

Genres
Traditional Korean music is deeply related to religious cultures, such as Buddhism,
Confucianism, Shamanism, and Taoism. This close connection between music and religion
has affected the history of Korean music. Though there are various ways to classify the
genres of Korean traditional music, according to its origin, usage, or instrumentation, it
usually falls into two main categories: court music and folk music.17
Current court music of Korea indicates the music which was performed in the court
during the Joseon dynasty. It has been subdivided into three categories by origin: aak,
dangak, and hyangak. Aak literally means “elegant music,” originally used by Confucius to

distinguish good and beneficial music from bad and harmful.18 Dangak refers to the music
which came from the Chinese Tang dynasty (618-907). Dangak is similar to aak in that both
are barely played and have Chinese influences. On the contrary, hyangak, literally “local
music,” is a native Korean court music, derived from Three Kingdoms Period. Like aak and
dangak, hyangak combines the three elements of playing musical instruments, singing, and
dancing for the ritual.19
While court music is defined as refined and serene for the ruling class, folk music
belongs to the common people, reflecting full of vigor.20 Based on folk tunes and
instrumental works in various forms, folk music can be sorted into two groups, as illustrated
in Table 2.1.21

Additionally, religious music can be characterized by two affiliations: Buddhism and
Shamanism. Buddhist music consists of the ritual dance (jakbeop), the outdoor band (chwita),
the ritual chants (the sutra, yeombul and the solemn chant, beompae), and the dance
accompaniment ensemble (samhyeon yukgak).22 Korean shamanic music can largely be
assigned to five geographical areas: Northwestern, Midwestern, Southwestern, Eastern, and
Jeju shamanic music, including the gut (shaman ritual including songs and rhythmic
movements) and sometimes the sinawi.23

Modes
Korean music involves two modes based on the pentatonic scale (G-A-C-D-E):
pyeongjo (Eb-F-Ab-Bb-C), corresponding to the first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth degrees of
the major scale in Western music, is characterized by peaceful and cheerful sounds;
gyemyeonjo (Eb-Gb-Ab-Bb-Db), corresponds to the first, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh
degrees of the minor scale, and thus is often used to convey a sad atmosphere.24
As Korean traditional music does not have harmonic structure, some notes within a
melody are frequently emphasized to create unique meanings or tone colors in accordance
with specific performance techniques: yosung, toesung, choosung, and jeonsung. Yosung
means “typical vibrato;” toesung “descending glissando;” choosung “ascending glissando;”

and jeonsung “appoggiatura.”25 Pyeongjo and gyemyeonjo both vibrate the tonic (yosung).
However, pyeongjo bends the second and sixth degrees of the scale downwards (toesung)
when they are in a descending motion, whereas gyemyeonjo does so only for the fifth degree.
As the gyemyeonjo was passed down through generations, it was altered by omitting one or
two notes (the third or seventh degrees of the scale); the resulting gyemyeonjo has four (the
first, fourth, fifth, and seventh scale degrees) or three notes (the first, fourth, and fifth).

Instruments
Traditional Korean instruments—almost sixty are in regular use—can be organized
according to their materials, origins, and uses. Korean instruments are grouped by eight
instrument materials—metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood—and by
where they originated; some traditional instruments appear to be indigenous to Korea, and
others have been introduced from China, Central Asia, and other places.27 They are often
discussed according to their usage: Chinese classical music, Chinese secular music, and
native Korean music.28 Nowadays, Korean traditional instruments can be categorized into
three groups as in Western classical instruments: string, wind, and percussion. These are
briefly summarized in Table 2.2.29

Rhythmic Patterns
The most important ingredient of Korean music is a rhythmic pattern, jangdan; jang
means long, dan short. Most Korean musical genres are comprised of jangdan, including
court music and folk music; court music utilizes much slower jangdan than folk music.30
Each rhythmic cycle begins on a strong downbeat, sometimes places an accent on a weak
beat, and has its own tempo and time signature as in Western music. The regular pattern is

21

improvised or varied by the performer, and repeated throughout the composition to provide
the overall framework; this will be illustrated in the discussion of Lee’s use of several
traditional rhythms to portray the dance-like moods in the three Nori works for piano.
The most widely used instrument for jangdan is janggu. It is a double-headed
hourglass drum; the higher-pitched right head is struck with a thin long stick, the lowerpitched left head played with a mallet or hand. The right head notes are notated with upstems, the left head with down-stems.31 Several essential elements in playing janggu are
described in Table 2.3 in terms of symbols, oral sounds, and notations.32 Played with janggu,
jangdan has three or four compound beats and spans from jinyangjo (slow), gutgeori
(medium), jungmori, jungjungmori (medium-fast), semachi, jajinmori (fast), and hwimori
(very fast) in accordance with tempo. The basic forms are presented in Table 2.4.33

Ornamentation
Ornamentation, or sigimsae, is one of the most distinct features of Korean music.
Usually translated as “embellishment,” it consists of decorative notes before or after the
24

principal notes of the melody, and can be flexibly improvised in variant forms by
performers.34 It must, however, be performed in the context of a melody; in doing so, it
creates musical direction and structure. Sigimsae is an important mark of technical skill, and
its subtlety gives expression to the performer’s feelings through the melody. Each performer’s
discreet interpretation enhances the dramatic emotions in the music.35
As mentioned earlier when describing the modes, there are four major styles of
sigimsae: yosung (vibrato), jeonsung (grace notes like appoggiatura), choosung (ascending
glissando), and toesung (descending glissando or portamento). In regard to the vibrato
technique, the term nonghyun is used for the stringed instruments, such as gayageum,
geomungo, or ajaeng; yosung is commonly applied to vocalists and wind instruments. The
vibrato of nonghyun is slower, wider, and deeper, and tends to produce a much warmer sound
compared to the Western musical style.36 The various figurations of sigimsae are shown in
Figure 2.1.37

Korean society has changed greatly over the past century, and the musical
community constitutes no exception. The cultural prosperity of today’s Korea could not be
possible without its traditional culture and arts. Consequently, although the three generations
of composers have explored ways to respond to international trends and influences, they have
nonetheless maintained elements of traditional Korean music that have been preserved and
promoted throughout the country’s long history. In the next chapter, I will use this context to
thoroughly address the background and stylistic peculiarities of Lee’s three Nori
compositions for piano.
26

Chapter 3
Stylistic Features of Three Nori Compositions for Piano
As Lee has searched for his own musical language, he has both maintained his
Korean traditional roots and absorbed modern Western techniques. Lee’s use of basic forms
and Korean traditional and Western musical devices are demonstrated in several major
features of the Nori compositions, where traditional Korean instruments, rhythms, and
melodies and twentieth-century harmonies and compositional techniques are naturally
combined.

Background of Nori
According to Lee, he began the Nori series with a desire to create a much freer
structure than possible in conventional Western forms such as sonata, rondo, or variations.1
Nori literally indicates “playing or performance.” Lee describes the term in a program note:
Nori is a musical piece that reveals the function of instruments and skill of a
performer through its free and impromptu element, not constrained by any specific
form and structure … This piece is characterized by elements of samulnori, an
ensemble made by four Korean traditional percussions … ornamental notes, Korean
folk tunes, and dance rhythms.2
Of the nine Nori compositions to date, four have been written for a solo instrument, and the
rest for small chamber ensembles: Honza Nori for Violin (1994), Honza Nori for Percussion
(2007), Honza Nori for Piano (2010), Honza Nori for Double Bass (2015); Doori Nori for

http://www.seoulcompetition.com/re/2011/LEE_Young_Jo-Piano_Honza_Nori.pdf; samulnori basically means
“playing with four instruments” and is performed by four traditional percussion instruments, such as
kkwaengwari, jing, janggu, and buk.

Violin and Piano (1995); Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano (2002), Sesi Nori for Violin,
Clarinet, and Piano (2009), Sesi Nori for Oboe, Cello and Piano (2010); and Nesi Nori for
Percussions (1998).3 In this document, these works will be discussed not in chronological
order, but according to the numbers of players involved: Honza means “alone or solo,” Doori
“two or duet,” and Sesi “three or trio.” By using Korean titles instead of “solo,” “duo,” and
“trio,” Lee presents the works as his reflections on Korean sentiments within Western musical
structure.
The three Nori compositions selected for this study were all commissioned: Doori
Nori for Violin and Piano, for Nam Yun Kim (violin) and Kyung-Sook Lee (piano); Sesi Nori
for Violin, Cello, and Piano, for the Huh Trio; and Honza Nori for Piano, for the seventh
Seoul International Music Competition Semi-Final.4 They are all single-movement virtuosic
works, sharing atonality and strong Korean traditional features in their dances, folk tunes,
ornaments, rhythmic modes, and instrument imitations. Each piece is through-composed, but
can be divided into several distinct parts according to tempi and other musical characteristics:
a gentle A section; an exciting B section; a contemplative C section; and a final section that
revisits the musical materials of the A and B sections. Both Honza Nori and Sesi Nori have
introduction sections as well; Honza Nori also has a short codetta.

Competition Semi-Final round in November 2010. Conveying elements of traditional music
in a Western fashion, it is the most recent and shortest—about five minutes duration—of the
three Nori works for piano discussed in this document. As the title indicates, Lee attempts to
encapsulate the wide-ranging expressiveness of the piano in a freer way in this work. As a
competition piece, it requires the performer’s polished technique and a great depth of
understanding of the music itself.5 Rhythmic energy is the most critical issue; other essential
factors coloring Lee’s harmonic language include adding notes to chords, polytonality,
chromaticism, pentatonic and octatonic scales, and frequent implications of a tonal center.6
Although not written in a specific conventional form, the work is sectionalized, with
an introduction, the A and B sections presenting the main musical materials, a meditative C
section, and a shortened recapitulation of the A section, plus a brief codetta (Table 3.1). Each
contrasting section is very compact and has distinct characteristics.

Introduction (mm. 1-13)
The 13-measure introduction clearly and concisely states the musical materials that
will dominate the work; these include imitations of Korean instruments, rhythms, and
harmonic devices. The sound of jing is invoked three times at mm. 1-3 by spacious perfect
fifth chords with added minor seconds ringing in the lower part of the piano; these become
the fundamental chords in the left hand at mm. 4-11, establishing D as a tonal center and
creating subtle tension with meter changes and ties. The added seconds are crucial to Lee’s
general harmonic practices; he employs them obsessively to make unique tone colors
throughout the piece (Example 3.1).
30

Example 3.1. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 1-8

The most significant Korean traditional music component involves the rhythmic
mode, jangdan. Lee uses and frequently varies several rhythmic patterns including jajinmori,
semachi, and hwimori to create musical vitality and excitement in the Nori works. In Honza
Nori for Piano, beginning at mm. 9-10, Lee employs the second type of jajinmori jangdan in
the right hand; this is the most extensively used rhythmic pattern in the piece (Examples 3.2a
and 3.2b).7

Jajinmori jangdan

Section A (mm. 14-23)
The A section starts with chromatic ascending motion and imitates the sounds of
traditional samulnori percussion instruments. Fast repetitive ostinato-like triplet figures in the
right hand recall the frequently-used technique of deoreoreoreo, rolling a stick on the right
side of janggu. The two-measure motivic melody presented in the right hand at mm. 4-7 is
now in the left hand with a changed rhythm (Example 3.3).

32

Example 3.3. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 14-19

In m. 20, an ascending octatonic scale in the right hand is played over a resonant
jing, a very gentle and lingering low tone based upon the open fifth chord with added second
(Examples 3.4a and 3.4b).
Example 3.4a. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, m. 20

33

Example 3.4b. Second-mode octatonic scale8

At mm. 22-23, descending right-hand chromatic figures in octaves and successive
left-hand diminished chords build up dramatic tension, preparing for the beginning of section
B (Example 3.5).
Example 3.5. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 22-23

Section B (mm. 24-74)
The longest and the most exhilarating area in the Honza Nori for Piano, the B
section, thoroughly explores cheerful new melodies and rhythmic excitement. This section
features melodies from two Korean folk tunes, Miryang Arirang and Arirang, which Lee
adapts according to the “setting technique of musical borrowing,” whereby a pre-existing
melody is given a new accompaniment.9 The borrowed materials appeal directly to Korean

8

An octatonic scale is any eight-note musical scale in which the notes alternate intervals of a whole
step and a half step. It has only two modes. Mode 1 begins with a whole step, Mode 2 with a half step.

J. Peter Burkholder, All Made of Tunes: Charles Ives and the Uses of Musical Borrowing (New
Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1995), 3-4; Burkholder identified the fourteen types of musical borrowing in
the music of Charles Ives: modeling, variations, paraphrasing, setting, cantus firmus, medley, quodlibet, stylistic
allusion, transcription, programmatic quotation, cumulative setting, collage, patchwork, and extended
paraphrase. Ives is one of the most well-known users of borrowed material in his compositions, incorporating
34

performers and audiences (Example 3.6).
Example 3.6. Anonymous, Miryang Arirang, mm. 1-4

In the beginning of the section, the first two measures of Miryang Arirang are used,
with the addition of major second notes to accentuated chords in the right hand and tripletlike accompaniments in the left hand (Example 3.7).
Example 3.7. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 24-25

At mm. 26-27, three interesting figures are succinctly presented: ascending and
descending octatonic scales in the right hand; the second altered type of jajinmori jangdan
and chromatic scales in the left hand (Example 3.8).

Jajinmori jangdan

There are three variant styles of semachi jangdan;10 Lee modifies the first two types
in his quotation of Miryang Arirang (Examples 3.9a and 3.9b). At mm. 28-29, excitement
increases as the chromatic line in the left hand begins to descend with accents and a
crescendo. These chromatic motions and chords combined with perfect fifths and major
seconds in Example 3.9b epitomize Lee’s melding of the traditional rhythms, folk melodies,
and his contemporary harmonic techniques.

Lee also includes gestures that recall percussion band music played by Korean
farmers, nongak; in the score, this is titled “Farmer’s Festival.” A celebration of community
spirit through music, nongak, also called pungmul, is a form of traditional Korean farmers’
music and dance, combining a percussion ensemble and sometimes wind instruments,
parading, dancing, drama, and acrobatic feats. The percussion bands are very common in
Korea, playing at many rituals, for fund-raising, and entertainment (Figure 3.1).11

Figure 3.1. Nongak group

In 1978, four percussionists—on jing, kkwaenggwari, janggu, and buk—adapted the sound
and spirit of nongak for the concert-hall stage, performing what is now known as
samulnori;12 in this form, it is performed solely for entertainment (Figure 3.2).13
Figure 3.2. Samulnori group

12

Samulnori was created from pungmul for an indoor performance in 1978 by Duk Soo Kim, the
group’s leader and master of the janggu. The performers (formally members of namsadang, the wandering
artist-entertainers) were Young Bae Kim (deceased 1985) who played the kkwaenggwari, Tae Hyun Choi on the
jing, Duck Soo Kim on the janggu, and Jong Dae Lee (now teaching at a university) on the buk. Soon after, Jong
Sil Choi took over on the kkwaenggwari, and Kwang Soo Lee on the buk. The group sparked a renaissance in
Korean music, touring as a quartet and garnering worldwide acclaim.
13

Ibid., 100-101.

The addition of seconds to the perfect fifth chords at mm. 30-32 creates a timbre
reminiscent of the buk, jing, and kkwaenggwari (Example 3.10).
Example 3.10. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 30-32

Simultaneous use of several scales is frequent in Lee’s music. At mm. 33-36, the
whole-tone and chromatic scales appear in both hands. At the same time, percussive rhythmic
patterns move into sequential passages, adding intensification (Example 3.11).
Example 3.11. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 33-36

At mm. 37-40, the ostinato-like patterns in the left hand exemplify the jajinmori jangdan;
there is also polytonal writing between the hands (Example 3.12).

39

Example 3.12. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 37-40

Jajinmori jangdan

The third jangdan used in the piece, at mm. 41-42, is hwimori jangdan, the fastest
traditional Korean rhythm. This suggest the gesture in which nongak players whirl their
sangmo (Korean traditional ribbon-hat) while dancing, as shown in Figure 3.1 (Example
3.13).
Example 3.13. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 41-42

Hwimori jangdan

40

The long ascending sequences beginning at m. 37 are soon transformed into swirling
sixteenth-note runs, through m. 54. A brilliant passage from mm. 55-63 is also dominated by
driving sixteenth notes and rapidly moving accompaniments; the arpeggiated figures from
three-note gyemyeonjo in the right hand continuously push forward (recall Example 2.1b),
while dance-like rhythmic patterns—such as two or three eight notes in irregular groupings—
in the left hand are shaped with accents and sforzando on the weak beat. Polytonality occurs
again at a climactic point, mm. 62-63; a pentatonic scale appears for the first time, while
Stravinsky is referenced through the “Petrushka” chord with inverted triads of C major and
F# major (Example 3.14).14

14

Kim, “Korean Dance Suite for Piano by Young Jo Lee,” 75; the Petrushka chord is a recurring
polytonal motif used in Stravinsky’s ballet Petrushka. It is famous not just because it is polytonal, but because it
is maximally polytonal. The two major triads of C major and F # major are a tritone apart and as far away from
each other as possible on the circle of fifths, creating the most dissonant tonal combination possible.
41

Example 3.14. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 53-63

42

Example 3.15 shows the transition from B to the C section, a recreation of the
opening chords consisting of perfect fifths and minor seconds (see Example 3.1). Db and Ebb
are added with a gradual diminuendo and ritardando over the obsessively repeating staccato
Gb; this then connects to another chord in the same pattern at m. 75 as C begins.
Example 3.15. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 64-76

Section C (mm. 75-96)
The C section starts with the sound of a gong played three times in a row, as in the
introduction. Lee maps out this perfect fifth and minor second chord throughout the C section
and also hints at a tonic center of E. In contrast to the A and B sections, it has very calm and
dreamy quality, entirely within mp or pp. Mm. 77-82 invoke the sound of Korean wind
instruments through ornamented melodies while quoting the most well-known Korean folk
tune, Arirang in the middle voice (Examples 3.16a and 3.16b).
43

Example 3.16a. Anonymous, Arirang, mm. 1-4

Lee ends section C very quietly and mysteriously at m. 94, with the Petrushka chord
(Example 3.17).

44

Section A´ (mm. 97-103)
The condensed A section returns in the same structure, but includes the tune of
Arirang in the left hand at mm. 99-102 (Example 3.18).
Example 3.18. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 99-102

Codetta (mm. 104-107)
A short four-bar codetta exhibits features similar to the final part of the B section;
Lee exactly quotes mm. 60-61 (compare to Example 3.16), reuses the Petrushka chord, and
concludes with authentic cadence gesture incorporating the triads of C major (V) to F major
(I) but still with added minor seconds (Example 3.19).

45

Example 3.19. Young Jo Lee, Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 103-107

The variety of Korean traditional elements and Western harmonic techniques
presented in Honza Nori for Piano exemplify Lee’s interest in blending both musical cultures.
The sounds of traditional Korean instruments, dance rhythms, and folk melodies combine
well with contemporary atonal features—such as the perfect fifth and added second chords,
augmented sixths, polytonal writings, and chromaticism—to create Lee’s distinctive
character. In addition, Lee’s writing for the piano is highly idiomatic, ably exploiting the
extended range of the instrument. These characteristics have secured Honza Nori’s place in
the performance repertoire.

Doori Nori for Violin and Piano
Doori Nori for Violin and Piano was written for two globally renowned performers
in 1995. The violinist, Nam Yun Kim (b. 1949), was a professor of violin at Korea National
University of Arts and now serves as a director at Korea National Institute for the Gifted in
Arts; the pianist, Kyung-Sook Lee (b. 1944,) is an emeritus professor of piano at Yonsei
University. This is the only work that Lee composed for two (Doori) instruments in the Nori
series, and is regarded as one of the most virtuosic of his compositions due to its technical
difficulties.15 Lee was inspired by the sound of Korean traditional stringed instruments,
which he sought to reproduce on the modern violin.16
Honza Nori for Piano and Doori Nori for Violin and Piano share many atonal
characteristics and avoid establishing functional harmony in terms of key, although Lee still
tends to suggest tonal implications by repeating specific notes or chords, and suggesting pitch
centers usually in the bass.17 Lee also employs several contrapuntal techniques in this work,
such as canon, augmentation, diminution, and stretto. The overall form is outlined below in
Table 3.3.

Section A (mm. 1-41)
The first section opens with the melody in the piano part at a moderate tempo; the
melodic figure at mm. 1-2 dominates the entire piece, often with rhythmic variations. I will
call this two-bar main subject “motive A” as a matter of convenience. The intervals between
notes are the primary musical material, alternating thirds and seconds; this melodic line
reverses the five notes of gyemyeonjo.
Gyemyeonjo

The importance of motive A in Doori Nori cannot be emphasized enough; while Lee
designates several melodies for each section in Honza Nori for Piano, motive A is
manipulated almost like monothematic transformation, excepting in the C section. The
thematic unity imparted to the work dominates its development (Example 3.20).

48

Example 3.20. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 1-2

At mm. 9-16, motive A appears in the violin part, with each note value doubled in the
manner of the fugal augmentation; the piano part arouses a meditative mood with lots of
ornaments and adds diverse harmonic colors to the violin. In the same passage, E is suggested
as a tonic center underneath the motive, bringing a sense of traditional tonality; the perfect
fifth chords that contain E in the bass occur every two or four measures, while the melodic
line in the right hand also hovers around an E tonal center.
Example 3.21. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 9-16

49

Similarly, while the harmonic progressions from mm. 20-38 are governed by chromatic
motion and consecutive French augmented sixth chords, reiterated syncopated E notes in the
bass at mm. 39-41 return to the established tonal center (Example 3.22).
Example 3.22. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 38-41

Section B (mm. 42-95)
Motive A is repeatedly subjected to changes in the B section. Lee adopts the minor
thirds from motive A obsessively for the violin, and involves an arpeggiated motive A in the
piano line. Consistent sixteenth-note figures in parallel motion between both hands create a
more energetic mood and a polytonal texture as well, with the simultaneous occurrence of A
major and G major at mm. 42-45; B minor and A major, Eb major and Db major, and B minor
and A major at mm. 46-48. These dual tonalities are all established in a supertonic
relationship, a major or minor second apart. The major second then joins the perfect fifth
chords at m. 49 (Example 3.23).

50

Example 3.23. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 42-49

Lee maintains a similar structure at mm. 50-61, but makes a variety of rhythmic changes to
motive A. At mm. 52-55, the motive appears in the violin not as a single melody but with
spacious perfect fifths; simultaneously, in the piano part the motive is presented in the left
hand with the rolled chords, while a broken D minor chord is repeated in the right hand.
From mm. 56-59, the perfect fifth material is given to the piano, and motive A to the violin
with sixteenth notes. Motive A is syncopated and accentuated in the violin over the rolled
chords in the piano, mm. 60-61. These motivic variations highlight the rhythmic diversity and
vitality of the piece (Example 3.24).

51

Example 3.24. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 50-61

In addition to the rhythmic matters, the B section involves much chromatic motion,
alternating the chromatic scales between the two instruments. A variant of gutgeori jangdan
in the piano is made up of perfect fifths and major seconds, and also creates greater rhythmic
excitement (Examples 3.25a and 3.25b).
52

Example 3.25b. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 76-77

Gutgeori jangdan18

The end of the B section is exuberantly energetic; three ascending octatonic scales, a
long high D# in the violin, chromatic scales, augmented thirds, major sevenths, and perpetual
sixteenth-note motions in the piano lead to the climactic point with an extremely atonal sound
and maximum dramatic effect (Example 3.26).

53

Example 3.26. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 90-93

Section C (mm. 96-133)
The C section is tranquil and slow. A great stillness is achieved through the unhurried
flow of music; Lee prefers to hold the long notes or chords, often with ties and rests, and
avoids ornamental notes. Harmonically, there is continued refinement and exploration: Lee’s
favorite French sixths in the piano provide a mystical touch and subtle tension (Example
3.27).

54

Example 3.27. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 96-102

Lee applies the nonghyun technique for Korean stringed instruments to the violin.
Nonghyun, a left-hand technique for Korean zither instruments that literally means “play with
strings,” embellishes melodic lines by shaking, pushing down, and plucking strings.19
Meanwhile, the ascending glissandi (choosung technique) with minor seconds in the violin
capture the tone color of the gayageum. The entirety of the Lento section is built on the two
variant types of semachi jangdan, moving slowly in three beats (Example 3.28).

55

Example 3.28. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 115-118

Semachi jangdan

Lee’s expansive use of chromatic scales is apparent in Example 3.29. Both the violin
and piano parts are involved in contrary motion; the two different textures, which remain
single melodic lines in the violin and chains of open fourths and fifths in the piano, create
heavy chromaticism and a fluid, misty tone quality. This extended chromatic motion leads to
French sixth chords again, quietly closing the C section.

56

Example 3.29. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm.126-132

Section B´ (mm. 134-224)
The B´ section is the most intense and demanding technically. Although not an exact
return of the B section—it is nearly doubled in length—B´ shares many of the earlier
section’s features: sixteenth-note figural writings, dance-like rhythms, accents, and
chromaticism. The pizzicati in the violin, mm. 135-158, provide exceedingly dynamic motion
and high cheerfulness. From mm. 134-144, motive A reappears in the piano in many guises,
including accentuated notes and syncopation. Lee also introduces another contrapuntal device
in the B´ section, treating motive A to diminution of rhythmic values at mm. 134-156;
eventually, each overlapping motive A between the violin and piano combines in a compact
stretto, at various pitch and time intervals, mm. 138-144. These fugal techniques based on the
motive provide structural solidity and unity (Example 3.30).

57

Example 3.30. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 137-144

Mm. 145-156 contain many ongoing lines; a number of canonic imitations occurs
between both instruments, accompanied by two octatonic scales in the piano. Motive A
returns in a new rhythmic figure, creating a more dynamic and vibrant atmosphere with many
rests at mm. 151-156 (Example 3.31).

58

Example 3.31. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 145-156

Motive A continuously reappears in the piano with alterations to the rhythm at mm.
165-168 and 170-172; in the violin, the syncopated motive enters over the pentatonic scale
(G-A-C-D-E) in the right hand of the piano part at mm. 168-172 (Example 3.32).

59

Example 3.32. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 165-172

Mm. 173-180 is extraordinarily passionate, and heavily atonal. Double and quadruple
stops on the violin produce a variety of colors, textures, and harmonies. These stops are
exclusively based on fifths and sevenths, and Lee also combines those chords; for instance,
quintal harmonies are constructed from the two fifths chords at m. 174, and mixtures of the
fifth and seventh follow at m. 180. In addition, two parallel sixteenth figurations in the piano
form consecutive tritones between both hands, creating profound dissonance. Motive A
appears at mm. 175-177 and m. 180. The structure of this passage is itself compelling, as
each bar has a different time signature, establishing an arch:
1/4→2/4→3/4→4/4→3/4→2/4→1/4. This ultimately results in an extremely tense, irregular
rhythmic pulse (Example 3.33).
60

Example 3.33. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 173-180

A new Allegro section starts in 6/8, leading to the climax (Example 3.34); it is
extensively dependent on open fifths in the violin, and perfect fifths with added major
seconds and dance rhythms derived from the third variant type of jajinmori jangdan in the
piano (recall Example 3.2a). The repetitive patterns of chords and rhythms in both
instruments reflect the sound of traditional percussion (kkwaenggwari and buk) and the
rollicking mood of nongak or samulnori.

61

Example 3.34. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 183-189

Jajinmori jangdan

The climax at the conclusion of this fast section is a summation of the motivic,
harmonic, and rhythmic vocabularies used in the piece: the repetitive minor third material
from motive A in the violin, tone clusters from two open fifths in the piano, and syncopated
rhythms at mm. 214-216, and descending chromatic movements and octatonic scales between
the instruments at mm. 217-221; a parallel motion with two octatonic scales a tritone apart in
the piano, mm. 222-224, raises a dissonant clash again (Example 3.35).
62

Example 3.35. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 214-224

Section A´ (mm. 225-253)
The A´ section is an abbreviated recapitulation of the A section; it finishes with a
short codetta-like passage, which lingers around the suggested tonal center G (Example 3.36).

63

Example 3.36. Young Jo Lee, Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 246-253

The most significant aspect of Doori Nori for Violin and Piano is Lee’s treatment of
motive A throughout the work. The motive itself is distinctly made of Korean traditional
elements, based on the five notes of the traditional gyemyeonjo; yet its development spans
frequent and varied rhythmic changes based on Korean modes to multiple fugal devices
including augmentations, diminutions, canons, and stretti. The forms of the motive exploit the
capabilities of the instruments and atonal chordal techniques; it is described not only with a
single melodic line but with intervals such as open fifths, added seconds, and tritones. Lee’s
skillful use of the motive thus incorporates diverse Korean and Western musical elements in
holding the music together and endowing it with organic unity.

64

Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano
Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano was written in 2002 and first performed a year
later by the Huh Trio, consisting of Hee-Jung Huh (violin), Yun-Jung Huh (cello), and SeungYeun Huh (piano).20 This work has also been arranged for two other ensembles: for Violin,
Clarinet, and Piano (2009), commissioned by the well-known clarinetist, Rok-Hyun Kwon;
and for Oboe, Cello, and Piano (2010), commissioned by the oboist, Suho Ha.21 All three
Sesi Nori arrangements are based on the same theme and structure; they have a few
differences due to the instrumentation and instrument registers.
Many features of Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano are analogous to those in
Doori Nori for Violin and Piano; in addition to overall atonal qualities, both are cast in the
arch form, develop monothematic material, often combine those with contrapuntal gestures,

The structure of Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano is clearly symmetrical: A and A´ gently
develop the main idea among the three instruments; B and B´ have exciting movement; C is
meditative and central to the work. The sections are not repeated verbatim, but share thematic
material.
Introduction (mm. 1-16)
Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano begins with a five-bar introduction; it is mainly
built on chromatic lines in the right hand of the piano and successive diminished seventh
chords in the left hand. As in Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, development of this chromatic
idea, which I call motive A, dominates the sections (Example 3.37).
Example 3.37. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 1-5

Lee’s obsessive chromaticism is evident at mm. 6-10. The violin and cello move
apart chromatically, with the piano lines doubling them—the soprano line in the piano
doubles the violin, the bass line the cello. These chromatic lines in the outer voices and
French sixth and tritone harmonies create highly post-tonal sounds (Example 3.38).

66

Example 3.38. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 7-10

Section A (mm. 17-50)
In contrast, the first part of the A section tends towards the tonal. At mm. 17-25, each
broken chord in the left hand of the piano implies noticeably tonal harmonies—G major, D
minor, E minor, Eb major, D major, C major, F major, Bb major, and Ab major—over the
repetition of B in the right hand. An overlapping of motive A between the violin and cello
makes a short stretto at mm. 18-22; the violin doubles the original motive, while the cello
slightly alters it (Example 3.39).

67

Example 3.39. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 16-27

As the chromatic line begins ascending in the violin, motive A appears in the piano
and cello in unison, mm. 28-29; these chromatic motions are accompanied by diminished
seventh chords in the piano, bringing back the sense of atonality (Example 3.40).

68

Example 3.40. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 28-31

Lee employs motive A at different times among the three instruments, forming the
first long stretto at mm. 32-43 (Example 3.41). Chains of open fourths and fifths—
sometimes containing thirds—appear in the piano, relying on extremely chromatic
progressions (mm. 34-40); this is reminiscent of a similar passage in Doori Nori for Violin
and Piano (Example 3. 29). The heavy chromaticism based on tritones and diminished
sevenths establishes a subtle tension and dark atmosphere throughout the stretto.

69

Example 3.41. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 32-43

By combining tonal, atonal, and chromatic gestures at a moderate tempo, the A
section exudes a restrained ambience.

70

Section B (mm. 51-99)
The lively and energetic B section has several similarities to that of Doori Nori for
Violin and Piano, including the use of contrapuntal devices such as imitations and stretti,
alternating motive A among the instruments, and sixteenth-note patterns in the piano which
induce a polytonal relationship between both hands. For instance, the beginning of the B
section in Sesi Nori, mm. 51-54, is very much akin to the same area in Doori Nori (compare
to Example 3.23), presenting the motive in the violin and fast sixteenths and polytonalities in
the piano (Example 3.42).
Example 3.42. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 50-54

71

While motive A continues to appear in the cello, numerous seconds, open fifths,
syncopated rhythms, and chromatic scales in the violin and piano build up dramatic tension at
mm. 59-77. In the piano, mm. 83-84, motive A in octaves with major seconds enters in the
right hand, producing a tone cluster-like sound effect, while chromatic and whole tone scales
rise and fall in the left hand (Example 3.43).
Example 3.43. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 83-84

Eventually, the persistent sixteenth-note figurations produce a four-voice stretto at
mm. 85-91, in the cello, piano right hand, violin, and piano left hand. The musical material in
the stretto is derived from the sixteenths in the violin, mm. 57-63; Lee alternates this sevenbar passage among the three instruments at mm. 57-77 and creates a two-voice stretto
between the cello and violin at mm. 78-84, which is then connected to the stretto for four
voices from m. 85. The gradual crescendo throughout the stretto, starting from an already
loud dynamic, increases the contrapuntal intensity and pushes towards a climactic point;
meanwhile, motive A occurs in octaves in the violin, mm. 89-90 (Example 3.44).

72

Example 3.44. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 85-90

From mm. 92-93, open fifths are linked to the octatonic scale in the violin, while
three parallel chromatic lines are created between the cello and piano; the two ascending
chromatic scales between both hands of the piano create intense tritones (Example 3.45).
73

Example 3.45. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 91-94

After these chromatic progressions, long notes in the violin (D#) and cello (B) in their
high registers and repetitive sixteenth-note patterns in the piano lead to an exceedingly atonal
climax at mm. 94-98. This highest point is analogous to the end of the B section in Doori
Nori for Violin and Piano (Examples 3.23 and 3.42); Lee exploits the same D# in the violin,
while chromatic scales and perpetual sixteenth-note motions in the piano create severe
dissonance (recall Example 3.26). The high D# in the violin is smoothly connected to the last
statement of motive A, and the B section concludes with ritardando at mm. 97-100 (Example
3.46). The fast sixteenths with stacatti, fugal devices, and syncopated rhythms all make the B
section the most brilliant and virtuosic part of Sesi Nori.

74

Example 3.46. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 97-99

Section C (mm. 100-155)
The C section of Sesi Nori, as in Doori Nori, is characterized by a wave of
ornamental notes recreating the sound of Korean wind instruments made of bamboo, such as
danso, daegeum, and piri. The improvisatory melodies in the piano and pizzicati in the violin
and cello amplify the meditative sound quality. The piano writing is polytonal: G major and
Db major, and Eb major and A major at m. 102; B major and F major, and C major and F#
major at m. 103; while the last two chords at m. 103 are Stravinsky’s Petrushka chord. As in
his other compositions, Lee adopts Korean traditional rhythmic patterns, but here alters it
rather than using the basic form of a given jangdan;22 the beginning of the C section suggests
a variant of the gutgeori jangdan at a slow tempo (Example 3.47).

Example 3.47. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 100-104

Gutgeori jangdan

A new theme appears in the piano at mm. 104-152; this is an exact quotation from
the A section of Doori Nori for Violin at mm. 9-24 (compare to Example 3.21). This sixteenbar melody is repeated three times throughout the C section. The sixteen measures can be
divided into two eight-bar phrases (e.g. mm.121-128 and mm. 129-136 in Example 3.48); the
first four-bar melodies of each phrase (e.g. mm. 121-124 and mm. 129-132) are based on the
76

five-note gyemyeonjo.
Gyemyeonjo

The quoted melody remains in the piano over pedal point-like chords, implying the
tonal center E; the violin and cello alternate playing motive A. This passage uses nonghyun
techniques: choosung (ascending glissandi) and jeonsung (grace notes like appoggiatura) in
the piano embellishments. Nonghyun is central to Korean traditional music, bringing the
monophonic melodies alive and adding various color effects; the melodic lines can be
elaborated according to the performer’s spirit and technique.23 The piano quietly plays the
recurring open fifths to close the C section (Example 3.48).
While the outer sections are weighted towards Western compositional devices
including atonality, chromaticism, and contrapuntal techniques, the central C section is
focused on more traditional aspects—woodwind-like sound, pentatonic scale, traditional
rhythmic patterns, and many embellished notes. The result is a contemplative atmosphere as
the turning point in a journey from the restraint of section A through the exuberance of
section B.

78

Section B´ (mm. 156-210)
Section B´ recapitulates section B from mm. 156-202, and continues with new
material from mm. 203-210. The reiterated portion comes to a climax at mm. 199-203; the
three instruments then descend together at mm. 204-208. Motive A appears in the violin and
cello in unison for the last time in the B´ section, descending an octave. Chromatic scales in
the piano, with hands also in unison, descend even further by three octaves (Example 3.49).

79

Example 3.49. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 203-208

The dynamic, vigorous B´ section finishes with repetitive B notes at mm. 208-210,
foreshadowing the tonic center B of the following A´ section (Example 3.50).

Example 3.50. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 209-210

Section A´ (mm. 211-226)
Like the other Nori works, the A´ section of Sesi Nori is a shortened repeat of the A
section; here, Lee omits the second half of the A section (corresponding to mm. 28-50). B is
finally reaffirmed as a tonal center through pp repetition of the pitch B in all three
instruments (Example 3.51).
Example 3.51. Young Jo Lee, Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm. 221-226

81

In Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, Lee continues to display his enthusiasm for
musical syncretism; Korean traditional elements and Western compositional techniques are
well balanced in the work. As in Doori Nori, Lee utilizes monothematicism (motive A)
throughout Sesi Nori, bringing compositional unity. The motive is both combined with
traditional Korean ornamentations and instrumental sounds, and developed through
contrapuntal devices (augmentations, canons, and stretti), tonal and atonal qualities (pedal
points, tritones, diminished sevenths, French sixths, and excessive chromaticism), and
various rhythmic alterations. Additionally, Lee adeptly captures a unique timbre of each
instrument and at the same time creates a harmonious balance between them. These features
have made Sesi Nori warmly welcomed by numerous chamber music players and audiences.

82

Piano Performance Issues
In performing these works, it is necessary to understand how Lee’s idiomatic pianism
integrates Korean and contemporary Western musical language. In the three Nori works,
Korean traditional instruments, jangdan, rapidly shifting meters, added seconds to the perfect
fifth chords, augmented sixths, diminished sevenths, chromaticism, polytonal writing, and
some tonal allusions are prominent; the performer must therefore be intimately familiar with
these elements.
The most critical matter is a solid awareness of the traditional instruments, required
to accurately reproduce each distinct sound on the piano. For percussive effects, strong and
detached finger touch as well as drier pedaling are essential. In Honza Nori for Piano, mm.
15-19, the repeated B in the right hand must emulate the sound of janggu, but it is difficult to
play these notes evenly and delicately; I suggest that the performer articulate each B with a
light touch (recall Example 3.3). At mm. 30-32, the buk, jing, and kkwaenggwari are evoked
in the open sonority created by accentuated fifths with added notes in both hands; the
performer needs to listen to the resonance of the chords carefully, mimic a percussive quality
by playing with the tips of the firm fingers, and establish an exciting, dancelike mood. Here,
the cross hand technique requires controlling both the constant rhythmic figures in the right
hand and the wide leap in the left hand in a fast tempo; the performer should prepare for the
leaps while keeping the pulse throughout (Example 3.10).
The structure of Doori Nori for Violin and Piano, mm. 184-189 (Example 3.34) is
similar to Honza Nori for Piano (Example 3.10): incessant open fifths in the violin and dancelike rhythmic patterns based on the perfect fifth chords with added seconds in the piano
evoke the sound of traditional Korean percussion. In addition to presenting this
percussiveness, rhythmic control between the violin and piano is required; both players
83

should keep the steady pulse during the fast 6/8. In particular, when they have accentuations
at different beats, both performers have to be very careful not to disturb each other’s part.
Before playing at the original tempo, they must practice slowly together to feel the two-beat
rhythmic base and enjoy the irregular accents on weak beats; this will allow them to facilitate
greater coordination between the instruments and convey the cheerful and percussive
characteristics.
Example 3.16b shows the middle section of Honza Nori for Piano, mm. 77-82. This
sections depicts the sound of Korean wind instruments, such as danso, daegeum, or piri,
through ornamented melodies. It is written on three staves, quoting the most well-known
Korean folk tune, Arirang in the middle voice. To balance the multi-layered voices, each part
should be practiced separately, to perfect hearing and phrasing of the individual voices; the
performer should then practice the voices together but without the ornamental notes, and in
time can add them freely. This approach will help to clarify the main melodic structure.
As discussed in the previous chapter, sigimsae is played according to each
performer’s emotions and expressions.24 In spite of a strong improvisatory tendency, it
should be performed in the context of a melodic progression. Several ornamentations
(jeonsung) from Figure 2.1 are presented in Examples 3.52a and 3.52b. It is valuable to
identify these embellishments in advance of practicing, and thereafter apply them properly to
the music with the performer’s inner emotions. Lee utilizes the original or variant ornaments
not only to imitate the sound of traditional wind instruments but also to emphasize the main
melodic notes; these ornamental notes often gravitate toward the central tones, intimating a
certain tonality. For instance, in the piano part of Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, mm.

24

84

142-145, most of the tunes with appoggiaturas revolve around “E,” indicating a tonal center;
practicing without the decorative notes will be necessary to be aware of these pivotal tones
and structural functions (Example 3.52b).

The performer needs to understand the types of jangdan and execute them
recognizably; maintaining rhythmic clarity allows for the full expression of a variety of
moods, such as excitement and emotional intensity.25 To better understand Lee’s use of
traditional instruments or performance techniques (i.e. Korean ornamentation and
improvisation), I suggest listening to Korean traditional music repeatedly to develop a feeling
for its characteristics: vocal music—minyo (folk songs) and pansori (musical storytelling by a
singer and a drummer); instrumental music—sanjo (virtuosic solo instrumental music
accompanied by percussion) and samulnori. A comprehensive study of the genre’s features
should come prior to any practicing.
Lee gives detailed metronome markings in the three Nori compositions. The basic
problem for each is to keep the metric pulse without either rushing the fast section or losing
momentum in the slow section.
In addition, the frequent meter changes require practice with a metronome to
establish the basic tempo for each section. Example 3.33 in Doori Nori for Violin and Piano,
mm. 173-180, is a cascade of shifting meters. Lee alters the time signatures every measure
over twelve bars, leading to a more energetic mood. Characterized by syncopated rhythms in
the violin and continuous sixteenth-note runs in the piano, this section is very challenging for
both performers due to the driving but differing rhythmic patterns. They should practice
separately first to become accustomed to their own parts. To play the sixteenths clearly and
evenly, the pianist must be conscious of the repetitive and parallel motions, feel the tritone

25

Lee manipulates the four types of jangdan in the three Nori compositions: jajinmori, semachi,
hwimori, and gutgeori jangdan. For further information, recall several examples for each rhythmic pattern:
jajinmori jangdan—Examples 3.2b, 3.8, 3.12, and 3.34; semachi jangdan—Examples 3.9b and 3.28; hwimori
jangdan—Example 3.13; gutgeori jangdan—Examples 3.25b and 3.47.
86

dissonance generated between both hands, and group them differently according to the
kaleidoscopic meters. On the other hand, the violin player should prepare for the double and
quadruple stops in time to maintain rhythmic intensity and enjoy syncopation that often
emphasizes the off-beat. Practice with subdivided beats will be helpful for both performers to
appreciate each other’s rhythmic pulse; they then can bring together the huge energy to create
much more dramatic tension.
Aside from the increased use of added seconds to the perfect fifth chords, Lee’s
preeminent harmonic interest lies in the frequent adoption of augmented sixths (especially
French sixths), diminished sevenths, polychords, and chromaticism, presenting diverse colors
and atonal sound qualities. For exuberant harmonic practices, the performer needs to know
each chord’s function in the context of musical structure. Example 3.29 in Doori Nori for
Violin and Piano relates to the colors of chromaticism and French sixths; a contemplative
ambience can be established by rich, sensitive, and sometimes flutter pedaling; since the final
decision in pedaling comes from the pianist’s ear, careful listening is essential. The polytonal
passages should first be played separately to hear each harmonic color and then can be
presented simultaneously as tone clusters, which are mostly heard as dissonant (recall
Examples 3. 17, 3.19, 3.23, and 3.42). In terms of tonal aspects, Lee employs pedal point-like
chords in the bass and constantly repeats a specific note; the performer needs to play and
listen to the central note or pedal tone, and secure each tonal implication (Examples 3.1,
3.16b, 3.21, 3.36, and 3.48).
As Lee highlights the equal relationships between the instruments, carefully
balancing them will prove most demanding both in Doori Nori for Violin and Piano and Sesi
Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano; performers especially need to be very sensitive when
playing all together f to ff, often with sfz. In Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano, energetic
87

stretto provides counterpoint in fast sixteenth-note melodic motives with staccati, steadily
building a dramatic intensity toward a climax. Performers are expected to produce rich
orchestral sonorities through these thick polyphonic textures. Each of the themes in the three
instruments not only should be presented independently within f, but must also have a crisp
sound with the same articulation (Example 3.44).
Lee has managed to crystallize how he tries to combine the musical features from the
East and West in the three Nori compositions for piano. He has always worked on writing
music idiomatically for the piano, evidencing both a thorough knowledge of technique and a
deep understanding of the sonority of the piano and exploiting the instrument to its greatest
expressive qualities. Hence, the performer has to be fully aware of Lee’s distinct musical
language first, practice meticulously, and make the utmost use of the instrument itself.

88

Conclusion
Lee aspires to musically assert his identity as a part of the third generation of Korean
composers. While previous generations paid close attention to absorbing and imitating
Western classical music, he has been looking for an ideal Korean music at all times. His
constant efforts to combine the East and the West have borne fruit in diverse genres of music.
Lee’s contributions to twentieth-century keyboard literature have received much
recognition from numerous performers; as the harmony of traditional Korean and Western
musical features is highly impressive and understandable, his works are mostly well received
by audiences. Therefore, most of his compositions for piano have understandably been
commissioned by prominent Korean pianists. These have allowed Lee’s keyboard works to
appear frequently on the recital programs and the recording lists.
By detailing how Lee integrates Korean traditional music into Western formats
through the three Nori works for piano, this document has sought to help both performers and
listeners to better appreciate his piano music. Honza Nori for Piano, Doori Nori for Violin
and Piano, and Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano share a variety of traditional musical
elements: folk music—samulnori and farmer’s dance, nongak; modes—pentatonic scale (GA-C-D-E) and three- or five-note gyemyeonjo (alternating thirds and seconds); instruments—
percussion (buk, kkwaenggwari, jing, and janggu), woodwinds (danso, daegeum, piri), and
strings (gayageum, geomungo); rhythmic patterns (often modified)—jajinmori, semachi,
hwimori, and gutgeori jangdan; ornamentations—choosung technique for the violin and cello
and jeonsung for the piano. However, Lee aims not just to mimic Korean traditional music,
but to experiment and discover a new timbre of the sound by incorporating Western musical
components. Lee’s abundant use of Western compositional techniques used in the three Nori
works can be summarized as follows: through-composed forms; atonal qualities—added
89

second to the perfect fifths, unresolved augmented sixths (French sixths) and diminished
sevenths, quartal or quintal harmonies, polytonal writing (including references to Stravinsky’s
Petrushka chord), tone clusters, and chromatic, whole-tone, and octatonic scales; tonal
allusion—repeating specific central tones and chords (pedal points); setting technique of
musical borrowing—Miryang Arirang and Arirang; monothematic/motivic development;
contrapuntal devices—stretti, canonic imitations, augmentations, and diminutions; and
shifting meters.
From the perspective of an interpretive performer, this study has illuminated not only
Lee’s stylistic uniqueness but also the musical and technical issues of these three
compositions. The percussive, meditative effects, rhythmic liveliness and steadiness,
multifarious harmonic colors, and balancing between the instruments can be accomplished
through performers’ refined techniques and musicianship; deliberate articulation, touch,
pedaling, phrasing, and voicing, and a wide range of dynamics should be decided and
executed by performers’ incisive ears and fingers and emotional depth. Performers of these
pieces will benefit from this study’s exploration of stylistic features, enhancing their
performative interpretations and practices, and better positioning the pieces to gain wider
attention beyond Korea.

Appendix B
Interview with Young Jo Lee
October 23, 2015, Seoul, Korea

Hyo Jung Song: Can you tell me what motivated you to compose the Nori series?
Young Jo Lee: I have been commissioned by many chamber groups, and wrote in the forms
of Western style. However, to be free from this conventional structure of writing, I decided to
create a new music which became the Nori series. I was inspired by the way children were
playing. They have no set rule or form. Like that, the Nori works are in a free style. Nori
means “playing.” The title Honza (alone), Doori (two), and Sesi (three) are another name for
solo, duet, and trio. I like these Korean titles to show the beauty of Korean language.
Song: Do the elements of the Nori come from the samulnori?
Lee: Somehow, you can say that. The Nori works are characterized by the elements of
samulnori. I wanted to imitate the sound for percussions from samulnori: kkwaenggwari,
jing, janggu, and buk. Nesi Nori was composed for percussion but it is different from
samulnori in that Nesi Nori has a lot more instruments, not just four. I divided the percussions
into four groups, based on the materials: first, leather—timpani, snare drum, janggu, and buk;
second, wood—wood block, temple block, sticks, and bak; third, iron—cymbals and chime;
last, keyboard instrument—xylophone, vibraphone, and marimba. These instruments give
more different sonorities.
Song: How did you present Korean traditional elements through a Western instrument, piano,
in the Nori pieces?
Lee: I tried to highlight the traditional features and express them through contemporary
instruments such as piano, violin, and cello. I reinvented the traditional string techniques in
the gayageum, geomungo, and haegeum as pizzicato and glissando, etc., on the violin or
cello. To better understand them, you should listen to diverse Korean traditional music
including vocal music: pansori and Korean art songs.
Song: You transcribed the Sesi Nori for Violin, Cello, and Piano for other instrumentations.
What are they and is there special reason for [the transcription]?
Lee: There are two more versions for Sesi Nori for now: for violin, clarinet, and piano and
for oboe, cello, and piano. It was so spontaneous. The Sesi Nori for violin, cello, and piano
was written for the Huh Trio in 2002. Then, a well-known clarinetist asked me to transcribe it
for his ensemble after listening to the recording of Huh Trio. So I made that in 2009. And
then the same for the other transcription, for the oboe, cello, and piano; I transcribed it again
in 2010. All three [versions of] Sesi Nori are based on the same theme and structure, but have
a bit different parts due to the instrumentation and registers of each instrument. Interestingly,
I have been transcribing much music for different instrumentations. For Arirang, which is the
most famous Korean traditional song, I transcribed it for orchestra, string ensembles, solo
101

piano, two pianos, [solo] singers, and choirs. It is always my pleasure to transcribe or write
music for different genres and people.
Song: Is there any relationship between the Nori series and the Sori series?
Lee: Not really, but both of them have the titles in Korean. Sori means “sound.” I attempted
to present the distinctive sound of each instrument and specific techniques in them: the multisound of the clarinet, overtones created with the mouthpiece in the brass instruments etc.
Overall, I can say that the Nori and Sori series are all virtuosic works.
Song: You learned to play the clarinet, French horn, and piri besides the piano. How did they
help you in composing? How did you decide to learn the piri?
Lee: Learning many instruments was absolutely helpful to compose the orchestral works. As
you know, the composers are commissioned by so many performers from different genres at
all times. The composer needs to know (or even play) as many instruments as possible so that
he is able to produce the pieces that suit well each instrument with its particular techniques. I
have a long story about how fond I am of Korean traditional music. That story can be found
in my autobiography. Back to the question, I began to learn the piri with Jae-guk Jeong and
took some classes about Korean traditional music when I went to Yonsei University. That
experience had a strong influence on me to put traditional elements in my music.
Song: Can your musical style be divided into specific periods? For example, before studying
abroad, in Germany and the United States, and after returning to Korea?
Lee: Sorry but no. I went to Germany at the age of thirty-four. Before I went abroad, I
already had my own ideas and languages about musical style. I learned how to modernize my
compositional techniques when I studied in Germany and America. I have been very
interested in Korean traditional music since I was little, just as I like kimchi and some other
Korean foods. I pursued anti-Western musical style when I lived abroad. You will realize how
much I prefer using Korean titles if you look at my list of compositions.
Song: What would you like to give your audience through your music? Is there any specific
goal or philosophy?
Lee: It is not easy to say in few words what the music means to me. Hmm, for me,
composing is a free artistic way to express myself. It is so fundamental and the best means of
communication between me and the outside world. I have grown up and developed through
music as a person as well as a composer every day. In terms of my own musical styles and
aims, I would like to integrate our Korean traditional elements into Western musical language
naturally. I do wish that Korean musicians continue to perform, respect, and write (as
composers) our Korean music in many different forms, so that we can present Korean spirit
and identity to the world through music.
