ABSTRACT
Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is a transcription factor that regulates metabolic and
immune response genes in the setting of low oxygen tension and inflammation. We investigated
the function of HIF-1α in the host response to Histoplasma capsulatum since both mouse and
human granulomas induced by this pathogenic fungus develop hypoxic microenvironments
during the early adaptive immune response. Here we demonstrated that myeloid HIF-1αdeficient mice exhibited elevated fungal burden during the innate immune response (prior to
seven days post-infection) as well as decreased survival in response to a sublethal inoculum of H.
capsulatum. Deletion of HIF-1α in neutrophils or alveolar macrophages and DCs did not alter
fungal burden thus implicating Ms as the pivotal cell in host resistance. HIF-1α was stabilized
in Ms following infection. The absence of myeloid HIF-1α did not alter immune cell
recruitment to the lungs of infected animals but was associated with an elevation of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. IL-10 blockade restored protective immunity to the mutant mice.
Macrophages (M) constituted the majority of IL-10 producing cells. Increased activity of the
transcription factor CREB in HIF-1α-deficient Ms drove IL-10 production in response to H.
capsulatum. IL-10 inhibited M control of fungal growth in response to the activating cytokine
IFN-γ. Thus, we identified a critical function for M HIF-1α in tempering IL-10 production
following infection. We established that transcriptional regulation of IL-10 by HIF-1α and CREB
is critical for activation of M by IFN-γ and effective handling of H. capsulatum.
Our data provide insight into the mechanism of HIF-1α elevation in the host response to
H. capsulatum. In addition, we provide gene expression data that may help elucidate the immune
mechanisms that lead to fungal growth restriction. In summary, this investigation provides novel
insights into HIF-1α and IL-10 regulation in innate immune defense against H. capsulatum.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction

Histoplasmosis
i. H. capsulatum disease
Infection with H. capsulatum causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. This
fungus is a dimorphic ascomycete that grows in its hyphal form in soil and bird and bat guano.
Upon inhalation of spores, H. capsulatum transforms into the pathogenic yeast phase. This form
replicates within Ms that carry the yeast from the lungs to virtually any organ (1, 2). Induction
of adaptive immunity, particularly the type 1 helper T cell response (Th1), is required for
activation of Ms and efficient clearance of the yeast. Exposure to H. capsulatum usually results
in asymptomatic clearance; however, histoplasmosis can manifest as an acute flu-like pulmonary
illness, a chronic cavitary lung disease, or a progressive disseminated form depending upon the
immune status of the host (1). For example, immunocompromised individuals are especially at
risk for disseminated infection; the HIV pandemic resulted in a dramatic increase in lethal
histoplasmosis. Today, highly-active retroviral therapy (HAART) reduces this risk likely due to
the preservation of patient CD4 T cells (2). Other susceptible immunocompromised populations
include those with a recent organ transplant as well as individuals taking immunosuppressive
drugs such as TNF-α inhibitors or corticosteroids (3). Clinical disease can also develop in
immunocompetent individuals. Although the impact of a large inoculum on clinical disease
development is unknown, outbreaks in an immunocompetent population have occurred when
there is a localized exposure to a large infectious dose (4).
Cases of histoplasmosis occur worldwide, but are concentrated in endemic regions. The
North American area is centered on the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. Large surveys of skin
testing in the 1960s revealed that 80% of young adult men from this region were positive for H.

2

capsulatum exposure (1, 5). Disease burden is regional; an analysis of United States hospital
records estimated 3370 inpatient stays and 254 deaths associated with histoplasmosis in 2002,
with almost 90% of hospitalizations occurring in Midwest and Southern states (6). Central and
South America contain large endemic areas, and reviews have brought attention to the underdiagnosed burden of HIV-associated histoplasmosis in these regions (7). Additional endemic foci
are in China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Australia, and Africa (8).

ii. H. capsulatum phenotypic diversity
Isolates of H. capsulatum exhibit considerable genotypic and phenotypic variability
between and within these regions. Genetic analysis has revealed that this fungus is not
monophyletic and can be classified into seven or eight distinct clades (9). Genetic differences
between clades lead to differences in phenotype and virulence. Most isolates have both α- and βglucan in their cell walls, but isolates from the North American 2 clade lack α-glucan (10). While
α-glucan- strains account for the majority of infections in immunocompetent individuals in North
America, α-glucan+ infections are associated with HIV positive individuals (11). In mouse
models, α-glucan- yeast causes more severe disease than α-glucan+, but only at high infectious
inocula (12). Thus, H. capsulatum expression of α-glucan may limit the pathogenic potential
except in the setting of an elevated infectious dose or a defective adaptive immune response.
H. capsulatum is not contagious. Despite infection usually being a "dead end" for
replication, the pathogen appears specifically adapted to mammalian hosts. The transformation
from mycelial to yeast phase at 37°C is crucial for infection; strains lacking this ability are
avirulent (11). The yeast is equipped for evading intracellular killing by phagocytes, with
3

mechanisms to degrade reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulate lysosomal pH, and capture
essential nutrients that might otherwise be deprived (13–16). Many mammalian species are
infected with H. capsulatum and are accidental hosts that must cope with the yeast's capability
for survival within Ms. In human and mouse infection, Ms provide a niche for fungal
proliferation that cannot be halted without adaptive immunity.

iii. Fungal recognition
Immune cells use a variety of surface receptors to recognize and ingest H. capsulatum.
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and toll like
receptors (TLRs) are necessary for innate immune cytokine production and/or phagocytosis of
pathogenic fungi (17, 18). Dectin-1 recognition of β-(1,3)-glucan is required for optimal
proinflammatory cytokine production, but not phagocytosis of yeast cells; α-glucan on H.
capsulatum masks β -glucan recognition (19, 20). In humans, a rare mutation that decreases
surface expression of dectin-1 is not associated with a higher incidence of histoplasmosis. While
this seems to suggest that dectin-1 is not needed to combat infection, the unknown exposure rate
of these individuals to H. capsulatum makes it difficult to determine the role of dectin-1 in
human disease (21). Other CLRs such as dectin-2 and mincle bind this fungal pathogen, but their
role in immunity has not been elucidated (22).
While Ms and dendritic cells (DCs) exhibit overlapping expression of many surface
receptors, those utilized for phagocytosis are cell specific. Macrophages bind and ingest yeasts
via CD11/CD18 integrins while DCs utilize very late activation antigen 5 (VLA-5) to recognize
ligands heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) and cyclophilin A, respectively (23–25). CD11/CD18
4

blockade reduces, but does not prevent, H. capsulatum uptake by both human and mouse Ms;
this finding suggests that other receptors are capable of driving phagocytosis – at least in the
absence of CD11/CD18. In contrast to Ms, human DCs rely on VLA-5 for fungal recognition
(26). Differential pathogen recognition by Ms and DCs may trigger unique signaling cascades.
CD11b/CD18 triggers activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk and downstream production of
proinflammatory cytokines in Ms (20). VLA-5, on the other hand, activates kinases that
regulate proliferation and survival including ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt. This leads to
production of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, which may prevent fungal driven apoptosis (27). Thus,
engagement of different receptors on these phagocytes may account for the contrasting
intracellular fate of the organism.

Figure 1.1 Macrophage and dendritic cell recognition of H. capsulatum
Macrophages recognize H. capsulatum via CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and dectin-1. While CR3 is required for
phagocytosis, CR3 and dectin-1 are both required for cytokine production, which occurs via Syk/JNK/AP-1
signaling pathway. Dendritic cells recognize H. capsulatum via VLA-5, which can signal through ERK/MAPK as
well as PI3K/Akt pathways.

5

Innate immune response
Following H. capsulatum recognition, appropriate cell mobilization is required for an
effective immune response. Neutrophils (PMNs) and Ms are recruited early to the site of
infection and their roles will be covered below.
i. PMNs
Human PMNs are fungistatic, not fungicidal, against H. capsulatum (28). This activity
relies on cathepsin G, defensins, and bactericidal-permeability-increasing protein (BPI) within
azurophilic granules (28). Neutrophil depletion studies in the mouse model have addressed the
influence of these cells in host defense. These studies demonstrated decreased survival and
elevated fungal burden associated with decreased PMNs (29, 30). However, the antibody used in
these studies is now known to recognize both PMNs and inflammatory monocytes; therefore the
role of PMNs is still unsettled (30). Although neutropenic patients are at risk for some fungal
pathologies, histoplasmosis is not among them (31). We will show that PMNs do not contribute
to the mouse control of fungal burden in chapter 2 of this thesis. Thus, PMNs are not critical in
the immune response to H. capsulatum.

ii. Macrophages
Macrophage activation is critical for control of intracellular H. capsulatum growth (32).
IFN-γ and GM-CSF are utilized for mouse M activation while GM-CSF, M-CSF, and IL-3 are
essential in human cells. The mechanisms of growth restriction are distinct in mouse and human
cells. While phagosome acidification is used by mouse Ms for growth restriction, it is

6

dispensable within human Ms (33). H. capsulatum phagocytosis stimulates a respiratory burst
within human Ms; mouse M production of ROS requires opsonized yeast or activation with
GM-CSF (34, 35). Studies utilizing NADPH oxidase deficient mice suggest that inhibition of
fungal replication in vivo may require ROS production (36). However, ROS do not directly
inhibit fungal growth; therefore, its importance is likely as a signaling molecule (13, 36, 37).
Additional mechanisms of inhibition suggested by in vitro studies include reactive nitrogen
species and metal deprivation (35, 38, 39). Even with activation, Ms cannot efficiently sterilize
tissues and thus harbor H. capsulatum (32).

Adaptive immune response
i. DCs
As the most potent antigen-presenting cells, DCs provide a link between innate and
adaptive immunity. Human DCs are capable of killing H. capsulatum (26). This fungicidal
activity was dependent on lysosomal hydrolases, but not the respiratory burst or nitric oxide
production. DCs drive CD4+ or CD8+ T cell proliferation by presenting fungal antigen directly or
from apoptotic Ms, respectively (26, 40). Adoptively transferred H. capsulatum-loaded DCs are
able to suppress maladaptive IL-4 production and improve survival following CD4+ depletion
(41). The DC ability to kill yeast and present antigen indicates that they are capable of driving a
T cell response even prior even prior to an activating signal.

ii. T cells
7

Early studies demonstrated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are necessary for an effective
immune response to H. capsulatum infection; nude mice that lack T cells exhibit high mortality
following a low dose infection with this pathogen (42). CD4+ T cell depletion during primary
infection of mice led to increased morbidity while loss of CD8+ T cells decreased clearance
efficiency but did not lead to mouse death (43). Following vaccination, CD8+ T cells confer
protection in the absence of CD4+ T cells; conversely, CD4+ T cells confer protection in the
absence of CD8+ T cells (44). Increased mortality and fungal burden in the absence of T cells is
caused by a lack of protective cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α (43, 45). An increased
incidence of histoplasmosis in AIDS patients supports the protective role of CD4 + T cells in
humans.
Reactivation of disease can occur when latent H. capsulatum sequestered in granulomas
in the lung replicate. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells influence mouse reactivation (46). Elimination of
both of these T cell populations six weeks after infection elevates fungal burden (46). AIDS
patients living in non-endemic areas exhibit reactivation disease concomitant with low CD4+ T
cell counts (47).
CD4+ T cells in clinical histoplasmosis
Our understanding of the importance of CD4+ cells in histoplasmosis has emerged from
observations in both mice and humans. By 1971, physicians noted that patients with
histoplasmosis usually exhibited an increase in T or B lymphocytes, while patients with
progressive disseminated disease tended to lack this response (42). Early studies in athymic mice
confirmed the importance of T cells for control of histoplasmosis (42). In the 1980s, the HIV
epidemic brought a dramatic increase in histoplasmosis incidence, severity, and awareness. An
impaired CD4+ T cell response is the major risk factor. A recent study found that the majority of
8

HIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/mm3 will develop
histoplasmosis (48). Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis typically presents in those with
low CD4+ T cell counts (<100 cells/mm3). Today most instances occur in patients not receiving
HAART. Mortality in this group may approach 50% (2). Work in Central and South America
have demonstrated that it continues to be a leading cause of death in AIDS patients although it is
likely under-diagnosed and untreated (49).
Patients taking medications that suppress CD4+ T cell number or function are another
major population with increased risk for histoplasmosis, particularly disseminated disease.
Immunosuppressive agents that influence T cell function and/or number include steroids, folic
acid analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, and targeted monoclonal antibodies. Glucocorticoids
effect all immune cell types, but have an especially dramatic influence on T cell number and
function (50). High dose glucocorticoids, either alone or in combination with other
immunosuppressive agents, have been linked to histoplasmosis (51–53). Immunosuppressants
that target T cells are associated with cases of histoplasmosis (54–56). Exact assessment of risk
is difficult because many patients take multiple medications, have an underlying condition that
may influence immunity, or both.
A. Th1
During infection, CD4+ T cells polarize into several helper phenotypes such as Th1, Th2,
Th17, and T regulatory cells (Treg) with unique cytokine profiles (57). Following pathogen
exposure, antigen presenting cells produce IL-12 that promotes Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ
production (58). Mutations in the IL-12 pathway are associated with increased risk of fungal
infections (59, 60). In mouse histoplasmosis, IL-12 blockade accelerates mouse mortality in an

9

IFN-γ-dependent manner (61). While the source of IL-12 is not clear, activated Ms and
dendritic cells are known producers following activation (62).
In histoplasmosis, IFN-γ is produced primarily by Th1 cells, activates intracellular
killing, and is necessary for control of primary infection (63). The role of IFN-γ in secondary
infection is not clear since some groups have found that it contributes to survival while others
have neutralized it with no effect (29, 63). The importance of IFN-γ signaling in humans has
been established with reports linking genetic deficiency in the receptor to disseminated disease
(64). The impact of this cytokine will be discussed in the cytokine section below.
B. Th17
Th17 cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IL-6, and GM-CSF. The Th17
response is important for controlling fungal infections including Candida albicans,
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Coccidioides posadasii and may be
beneficial but not essential for control of H. capsulatum (65). In wild-type mice, IL-17
neutralization results in a larger fungal burden starting at day 7 post-infection and continuing
through resolution, but does not alter mouse survival (66). Elevated IL-17 improves fungal
clearance in the CCR5 KO mouse (67). CCR5 KO mice exhibit a shift toward Th17 which leads
to decreased Treg numbers (67). These mice have accelerated clearance of H. capsulatum; both
the elevation in Th17 and depression of Treg response may improve intracellular killing. In
humans, Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is defined by a mutation in STAT3 leading to decreased
Th17 cells. Even though HIES is a rare disorder, there are several case reports of HIES patients
that developed disseminated or gastrointestinal histoplasmosis (68). The fact that the
gastrointestinal tissue is a target in most of these patients suggests that, as with mucosal

10

candidiasis, Th17 cells may be more important in the regulation of mucosal rather than systemic
immunity for H. capsulatum.
C. Th2
In contrast to Th1 and Th17, cytokines representative of Th2 responses, including IL-4,
IL-5, and IL-13, exacerbate histoplasmosis. IL-4 is a central type 2 cytokine, and transgenic mice
over-expressing IL-4 exhibit delayed fungal clearance (69). CCR2 KO mice also exhibit
increased IL-4 production and impaired clearance (70). In these mice IL-4 triggers production of
another Th2-associated cytokine, IL-33, by infected Ms (71). Neutralization of either IL-4 or
IL-33 improves H. capsulatum clearance in this model.
There are multiple mechanisms by which Th2 cytokines dampen host immunity. IL-4 and
IL-13 promote alternative activation of Ms. H. capsulatum proliferates in Ms primed with IL4 as opposed to those activated with GM-CSF or IFN-γ Ms (72). IL-4 also enhances
intracellular survival by increasing cellular zinc content (72). In addition to providing zinc for
the pathogen, prevention of zinc sequestration limits the M oxidative burst (35).
D. Treg
Tregs mediate immune suppression in several ways, including cell-cell interactions and
production of cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β (57). A CD4+ CD25+ population, which was
presumed to be Tregs, is increased in infected mice treated with anti-TNF-α and infected with H.
capsulatum (73). This population is able to suppress antigen-specific T cell proliferation via IL10 production. While the importance of Tregs during H. capsulatum is largely unknown, IL-10
impedes clearance of this pathogen (74). These data suggest that Treg production of IL-10

11

inhibits immunity, but more studies are necessary to determine the impact of this population in
vivo.

iii. B cells
The protective effect of antibodies that develop after H. capsulatum infection is currently
unclear. Early adoptive transfer studies of mouse serum from immunized mice did not protect
mice subsequently infected with H. capsulatum (75). However, more recent studies have
demonstrated that polyclonal antibody preparations may generate divergent results as a
consequence of the presence of protective, non-protective, and inhibitory antibodies (76).
Immunoglobulins generated by the host in response to fungal pathogens typically target cell wall
components including β-glucan and heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) (77). Monoclonal antibodies
to H. capsulatum surface ligands histone 2B and hsp60 are protective (78). Nevertheless, B cell
knockout mice exhibit no change in fungal burden during primary infection but exhibit elevated
fungal burden and a prolonged resolution in secondary disease (43). These results suggest that
humoral immunity is not as important as cellular immunity, but that it may contribute to the
immune response primarily during secondary infection. Given the high rate of infection in
endemic regions, this may be a critical factor in patients that develop histoplasmosis after living
for a prolonged period in one of these areas.

Metals in immunity
Deprivation of trace metals is an effective immune strategy to slow or stop an infection.
In mouse histoplasmosis, activation of Ms involves mechanisms that limit at least two essential

12

minerals: iron and zinc. H. capsulatum must obtain iron bound to ferritin or transferrin in the
phagosome/lysosome compartment in order to replicate. It possesses several means to
accomplish this including siderophores, ferric reductases, and maintenance of neutral pH (14–16,
79). Mouse Ms activated with IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide counteract fungal iron acquisition,
possibly via NO production; conversely, increasing iron availability increases yeast survival (38,
39). H. capsulatum control by NO has not been reported in human Ms.
Zinc must be obtained by an intracellular invader for survival and growth. Both human
and mouse Ms activated with GM-CSF upregulate metallothioneins, small metal-binding
proteins which reduce intracellular free zinc (35, 72). Metallothionein-driven reduction of zinc
supports production of ROS by increasing activity of the phagosomal H + channel (35). Thus,
GM-CSF's ability to inhibit yeast growth in Ms may be due to zinc deprivation and enhanced
ROS. In contrast to GM-CSF, IL-4 increases zinc availability to intracellular yeast (72).

Cytokines in H. capsulatum
Following differentiation into several helper phenotypes such as Th1 and T regulatory
cells (Treg), CD4+ T cells produce cytokines that shape the immune response. Loss of IFN-γ,
TNF-α, or GM-CSF can each independently increase mouse mortality in histoplasmosis while
loss of IL-10 promotes fungal clearance.
i. IFN-γ
In histoplasmosis, IFN-γ is produced primarily by Th1 cells with additional contribution
from CD8+ and γδ T cells as well as NK cells (80). While there are both IL-12-dependent and
independent pathways that drive IFN-γ synthesis, H. capsulatum largely if not exclusively
13

triggers IL-12-dependent production (61, 81). IL-12 blockade in mouse histoplasmosis
accelerates mortality in an IFN-γ-dependent manner (61). IFN-γ activates mouse Ms to inhibit
H. capsulatum growth through stimulation of nitric oxide generation (82, 83). The importance of
IFN-γ signaling in humans has been established with reports linking genetic deficiency in the
receptor to disseminated disease (64).

ii. TNF-α
TNF-α neutralization impairs survival of mice (84). TNF-α exerts multiple effects
including activation of phagocytic cells, induction of apoptosis, and control of the CD4 +
phenotype. TNF-α is critical for host defenses to H. capsulatum in both primary and secondary
infection. In primary infection, TNF-α blockade reduces nitric oxide production by Ms. In
contrast, the major defect in secondary infection is overproduction of detrimental IL-4 and IL-10
(84). In both primary and secondary infection, TNF-α neutralization abolishes the ability of
mouse T cells to mediate protection from H. capsulatum (85). This suggests that TNF-α is an
important signal to generate protective capacity in T cells in addition to effects on infected
phagocytes. Additionally TNF-α is essential for the induction of caspase activation and the
promotion of additional TNF-α production and apoptosis in infected Ms (86). This suggests a
protective mechanism in which permissive Ms release a burst of TNF-α to neighboring cells
during the process of apoptosis. While TNF-α does not activate M antifungal activity, this
release of cytokine may help prime the cell for infection.

14

TNF-α and Human Disease
Our understanding of the mechanism of TNF-α in histoplasmosis has evolved through
both mouse studies and clinical observations. The requirement of TNF-α for optimal control of
histoplasmosis was first observed in mice, and the ability of TNF-α to suppress detrimental
cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 was elucidated in this model (84). These findings predicted the
relevance for human disease, which was eventually revealed by the introduction of TNF-α
blocking therapeutics such as etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab. These medications
increase patient susceptibility to H. capsulatum, and patients are especially at risk for severe
disseminated infection (87). Histoplasmosis is the most commonly reported fungal infection
associated with TNF-blockers (87, 88). Clinical studies revealed the ability of TNF-α to
antagonize Tregs. Reduced Treg number and function in rheumatoid arthritis patients is restored
by TNF-α blockers (89). This observation prompted further studies in mouse histoplasmosis;
TNF-α blockade in mice was found to induce an expanded pool of H. capsulatum-specific
suppressive T cells (73). Unexpectedly, these T cells did not have typical Treg markers; therefore
TNF-α blockade may act by promoting suppressor function in non-Treg CD4+ populations (73).
Recent human studies have reflected this finding, showing that TNF-α blockers can induce
immunosuppressive features in Th17 cells (90). These data indicate that TNF-α is an important
mediator of protection against H. capsulatum in both mice and humans likely via its role in M
activation.

iii. GM-CSF

15

GM-CSF is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes activation of myeloid
cells such as Ms and PMNs. Neutralization leads to mouse death following H. capsulatum
infection (91). The elevated fungal burden in these mice is a consequence of enhanced IL-4 and
IL-10 as well as diminished IFN-γ and TNF-α (91). Recombinant GM-CSF promotes fungal
clearance in a dose dependent manner in the presence or absence of an antifungal drug (92). GMCSF acts at least in part by promoting fungistatic activity in Ms through sequestration of zinc, a
novel mechanism for pathogen control (35). The direct action of GM-CSF is likely responsible
for this phenomenon since cellular zinc redistribution does not occur in response to stimulation
with TNF-α (35). However, the overall contribution of cytokine production and zinc
sequestration to H. capsulatum growth restriction has not been elucidated.

iv. IL-10
IL-10 production and regulation are important in controlling the immune response to a
wide range of pathogenic microorganisms. IL-10 is secreted by immune cells including Ms,
dendritic cells, NK cells, PMNs, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Engagement of TLR2, TLR3,
TLR4, TLR9, or CLRs can drive IL-10 expression; recognition of fungal β-glucan by the CLR
dectin-1 can induce myeloid IL-10 production (93). Downstream Syk signaling requires mitogen
and stress-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MSK1/2) and the transcription factor cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB) (93). Among its diverse effects, this cytokine can
inhibit M antimicrobial activity by limiting production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (94–96).

16

During infection with H. capsulatum, T cells contribute to IL-10 release, but myeloid
cells are the predominant producing population (97). In the innate response to H. capsulatum, IL10 dampens immunity by limiting IFN-γ production; IL-10-/- mice exhibit elevated IFN-γ in
association with accelerated H. capsulatum clearance (74). Modulation of IFN-γ by IL-10
attenuates the activation of Ms which need IFN-γ to kill H. capsulatum (98). Thus, IL-10
inhibits IFN-γ signaling in H. capsulatum infection, which impedes fungal clearance.

Granuloma and hypoxia development
Granulomas are an organized collection of immune cells that form in response to a
stimulus including a variety of infectious agents such as H. capsulatum (99–101). The spatial
organization of cells within the granuloma is thought to create a microenvironment primed to
isolate inflammation, limit pathogen survival, and prevent further dissemination of infectious
agents (100). Extracellular and intracellular pathogens and infected Ms are found in the center,
which may be caseous and/or hypoxic. Here Ms can fuse to form giant cells although the
consequences of this change are not understood (102). Around this core there is a surrounding
sphere of uninfected activated Ms. An outer ring of T cells are important in directing granuloma
function through cytokine secretion. TNF-α and IL-10 are both critical for granuloma formation
and maintenance. In addition to its roles in M trafficking, the absence of TNF-α is associated
with disorganized granuloma development (103). Maintenance of well-formed granulomas also
requires TNF-α (104). IL-10 acts by restricting TNF-α production, inhibiting chemokine
production, and down-regulating M activation (105, 106). Biological modeling of this complex
system suggests that the balance between these pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is
necessary for control of pathogen growth without host damage (107).
17

The importance of TNF-α in both limiting organism growth and granuloma formation
and maintenance seems to support the notion that granulomas are a form of host protection.
However, the organism may benefit from this isolated environment as well. Recent evidence
suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced granulomas serve as a repository for
pathogenic organisms (101). Clinical cases of reactivation histoplasmosis, particularly in
individuals that have left endemic areas into regions that are not known to contain the fungus,
suggest that H. capsulatum granulomas may also contain viable organisms – although studies in
the 1950s indicated that healed granulomas only contained dead organisms (47, 108, 109). Since
H. capsulatum-infection leads to granuloma formation in the lungs and disseminated organs
(such as the liver and kidney), there is the potential for an infectious repository in several
anatomical locations (100, 110, 111).
Over time the microenvironment of the granuloma can exhibit decreased oxygen
availability; the contribution of increased metabolic demand of accumulating cells and decreased
oxygen delivery are unknown. Caseous necrosis, which is associated with tissue hypoxia, is
found in response to Mycobacteria tuberculosis as well as H. capsulatum granulomas (100, 112).
By day 7 post infection, H. capsulatum-induced granulomas exhibit hypoxia as assessed by
hypoxyprobe staining (113). While this limits fungal growth, it does not kill the organism.
Hypoxia within immune cells can also increase hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the
primary transcription factor in the response to low oxygen.

HIF-1α
i. Essential transcription factor in the response to hypoxia
18

HIF-1 was initially described as a mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia by Gregg
Semenza (114). This transcription factor was responsible for induction of erythropoietin
expression via binding to the hypoxia response element (HRE). The HRE was identified by first
generating plasmids that express a portion of the EPO gene enhancer 5’ to a reporter gene. The
relative amount of the reporter gene was determined in transfected cells exposed to hypoxia.
They then performed mutation analysis followed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) with a competitive nucleotide sequence to determine the pivotal nucleotides. They thus
identified the DNA binding region required for association of the protein complex that they
called HIF-1, which was necessary for hypoxia-induced expression of EPO.
It has since been demonstrated that HIF-1α regulates over 100 genes involved in oxygen
sensing, cell survival, cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell migration pathways (115,
116). The essential role of this transcription factor is demonstrated by the embryonic lethal
nature of the whole body knockout. Defective vascular development, neural fold defects, and
increased tissue hypoxia within these mice lead to mid-gestation loss (117, 118). The pathways
important in myeloid cells will be examined below.

ii. Oxygen-dependent regulation
HIF-1 is a multi-subunit transcription factor composed of a constitutively expressed β
subunit, HIF-1β/ARNT, and an oxygen labile α subunit, HIF-1α (119). The oxygen-dependent
degradation of HIF-1α is controlled via hydroxylation of the oxygen-dependent degradation
(ODD) domain (119). Prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing (PHD) enzymes are responsible for
hydroxylation of the ODD in the setting of low oxygen (120). There are three PHD isoforms
19

PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 with varying subcellular localization; PHD1 is expressed in the
nucleus while PHD2 is localized to the cytoplasm and PHD3 is found in both (121). PHD2 is
primarily responsible for HIF-1α hydroxylation. These enzymes require 3 co-factors for
function: O2, iron, and 2-oxoglutarate (121). The requirement for O2 as an essential co-factor is
what drives decreased activity in the setting of hypoxia, which is responsible for elevated HIF-1α
protein.
Following addition of hydroxyl groups, HIF-1α recognition by the von Hippel Lindau
tumor suppressor protein (VHL) allows for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S
proteasome (122, 123). In the setting of normoxia, the efficiency of this degradation machinery
reduces the half-life of HIF-1α to 5 minutes (124). This regulation is illustrated in Figure 1.2.

20

Figure 1.2 HIF-1α regulation in response to hypoxia and pathogens
In elevated O2, HIF is hydroxylated, recognized by PHD, ubiquitinated and targeted for proteosomal degradation. In
low O2, PHDs do not hydroxylate HIF, which permits binding to ARNT. Subsequent translocation to the nucleus
leads to HRE recognition and induction of downstream target genes. Pathogens elevate HIF-1α protein through
enhanced transcription or decreased degradation.

iii. Activation domains
HIF-1α contains N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains, N-TAD and CTAD, respectively. Hydroxylation of these domains modulates transcription of HIF-1α targets.
21

Full transactivation requires hydroxylation of the C-TAD, which is necessary for binding of the
CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 complex (125, 126). This complex is important for DNA
binding and recruitment of transcriptional machinery. Factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), an
oxygen-dependent hydroxylase, can modify an asparagine residue within the C-TAD to prevent
CBP/p300 association (127–129). These modifications work in concert to modulate HIF-1α
activity in various states of oxygenation.
While some data suggest that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of HIF-1α is associated
with increased HIF-1α transcriptional activity, data from other groups have shown that MAPKmediated phosphorylation prevents nuclear translocation (130, 131). Thus, further work needs to
be done to determine the contribution of MAPK-dependent phosphorylation in HIF-1α
activation.

iv. Drivers of HIF-1α expression
HIF-1α protein can be elevated via multiple mechanisms of stabilization or
transcriptional induction. Many of these methods occur in response to infection, which presents
an opportunity for the host and/or the pathogen to utilize HIF-1α for their own purpose.
Stabilization
Reduced activity or expression of PHDs (most importantly PHD2) leads to decreased
HIF-1α protein degradation and increased transcriptional activation (132). While this occurs in
the setting of low oxygen, PHDs also require the co-factors iron and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) for
activity. Since HIF-1α is constitutively expressed, even a transient decrease in PHD-dependent
hydroxylation can substantially increase protein accrual in the absence of transcription (132).
22

Long utilized to simulate hypoxia, the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) limits iron
availability, which increases HIF-1α by limiting PHD activity (133). Pathogens may create a low
intracellular iron environment by releasing siderophores that bind and sequester this metal. H.
capsulatum and several members of the Enterobacteriaceae family utilize siderophores to
acquire iron from host cells (15, 79, 134, 135). Bacterial siderophores have been shown to induce
HIF-1α expression through iron depletion while fungal siderophores have not been investigated
(135).
NO promotes HIF-1α accumulation via inhibition of PHD2 possibly via s-nitrosylation of
this protein (136). Indeed NO donors were able to enhance HIF-1α protein accumulation (137).
Overexpression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was able to drive HIF-1α accumulation in
these cells. As an example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which was previously known to
elicit VEGF production, enhances HIF-1α by driving NO production in epithelial cells (138).
Transcriptional induction
LPS can induce HIF-1α expression through increased transcription rather than protein
stabilization in the setting of normoxia (131, 139–141). Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) is required
for maximal expression of M HIF-1α and downstream cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-12 in
response to LPS or the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa; however, HIF-1α is increased in the setting of infection even in the absence of this
recognition receptor (139). These data demonstrate that recognition and signaling other than
TLR4 are capable of driving HIF-1α elevation in M.
Phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates translation of
HIF-1α via its downstream targets protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin

23

(mTOR) as shown in Fig. 1.3 (142–144). mTOR-dependent translational regulation occurs via 2
mechanisms. First, it phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
binding protein (4E-BP), which leads to the dissociation of these components (145). This allows
formation of the eIF4F complex, which is necessary for ribosomal binding of mRNA and
translation initiation. Second, mTOR phosphorylates p70S6K, which promotes translation of 5’
terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) mRNAs including HIF-1α (145).

Figure 1.3 HIF-1α regulation in response to PI3K signaling
PI3K signaling occurs in response to cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β. This drives activation of Akt and
mTOR. mTOR phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP),
which leads to the dissociation of these components (145). This allows formation of the eIF4F complex, which is

24

necessary for ribosomal binding of mRNA and translation initiation. mTOR also phosphorylates p70S6K, which
promotes translation of 5’ TOP mRNAs. These both act to enhance translation of HIF-1α.

Pathogen-associated HIF-1α increase via stabilization and/or transcription
Two of the first reports to implicate HIF-1α in the response to infection were in the
setting of Bartonella henselae and human herpesvirus-8 (146, 147). Both of these pathogens
drive aberrant proliferation of endothelial vasculature typically observed in HIV-infected
patients. Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a robust target of HIF-1α, the
contribution of this transcription factor was investigated in the response to these pathogens.
While both pathogens drove HIF-1α stabilization, the mechanism of induction was unclear.
However, stimulation with B. henselae-derived LPS was unable to increase HIF-1α (146).
Although many recent pathogen studies have ascribed elevated HIF-1α to an LPS response, this
suggests that not all LPS elicits the same reaction.
While the mechanism of HIF-1α protein stabilization and/or transcriptional induction is
unknown, it accumulates in the setting of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Vesicular
Stomatitis virus, Hepatitis B and C, Human Papilloma Virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania
amazonensis, and the fungal pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans (148–156).
These studies suggest that, while HIF-1α plays an undeniable role in the cellular response to
hypoxia, it may have been co-opted as a transcription factor in the response to pathogens as well.
In most of these studies HIF-1α is important for host protection and pathogen control, but
Chlamydia pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Leishmania amazonensis have utilized this
protein for their own purposes. This dichotomy will be explored below.

25

v. HIF regulated genes
Following protein accumulation, HIF-1α can translocate to the nucleus and bind to
functional components of the HIF-1 factor complex including HIF-1β and p300 as demonstrated
in Figure 1.2. The HIF-1 complex then binds to HREs to increase transcription.
HIF target genes fall into a variety of functional categories including cell
proliferation/survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, motility, glucose metabolism, and
extracellular matrix metabolism (157). The genes predominantly involved in host/pathogen
interactions would include those involved in immune cell recruitment, migration, and activation,
as well as those that play a key role in metabolism. Functional HREs have been described in the
promoters for MT2-MMP, β1 integrin, and β2 integrin, which are important for cell migration
(158–160). HIF-1α target genes that are known to play a role in the innate immune response
include CD11b, iNOS, cathelicidins, CRAMP, M migration inhibitor factor (MIF), the proinflammatory molecules TNF-α, IL-12, and CCL2 as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10 (161–164). Many of the glycolytic enzymes as well as the glucose transporters GLUT1 and
GLUT3 are chiefly dependent on HIF-1α (157). These regulators of metabolism may be
important since metabolic intermediates can alter immune cell activation or have direct
antimicrobial effects (165).

vi. Other isoforms

26

Two additional isoforms of HIF-1α exist: HIF-2α and HIF-3α (157). HIF-2α shares 48%
amino acid identity with HIF-1α (166). High sequence homology within the ODD leads to
similar oxygen-dependent protein stability of HIF-2α compared to HIF-1α. However, it is clear
that these genes are not entirely functionally redundant since knockout of either one is embryonic
lethal (117, 118, 167).
HIF-2α can also bind to ARNT/ HIF-1β and drive gene transcription through the same
HRE. The list of target genes for HIF-1α and HIF-2α is overlapping, but not identical (168).
Paradoxically in some situations HIF-1α and HIF-2α can have antagonistic functions (169). For
instance, in the setting of M polarization HIF-1α enhances NO synthesis while HIF-2α
suppresses it. HIF-1α and HIF-2α both induce VEGF production; HIF-2α is able to limit
angiogenesis by also driving production of the soluble VEGF receptor (170). The factors that
mediate differences in the HIF-1α and HIF-2α response are unclear, but one recent report
suggests that alterations in transcription factor complexes may be responsible (171).
HIF-3α, a more distantly related isoform, can also act as an oxygen-dependent
transcription factor (172). However, multiple splice variants and transcription initiation sites
have led to unique forms that are expressed in different tissues at different times. The impact of
these factors is complex since different variants can have opposite functions. Indeed a
conventional knockout mouse was generated, but the absence of several HIF-3α splice variants
has made it difficult to interpret the contribution of these variants to the phenotype of mutant
mice that exhibit enlarged right ventricle and pulmonary hyperplasia (173). HRE-reporter assays
suggest that HIF-3α can inhibit HIF-1α and HIF-2α driven gene expression, but other studies
have demonstrated HIF-3α-dependent induction of HIF-1α target genes EPO and GLUT1 (172).

27

Several splice variants of HIF-1α also exist in both human and mouse (157, 174–176). In
mice HIF-1α i.2 is the predominant isoform; it is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed (176).
HIF-1α i.1 is tissue specific and transcriptionally regulated (175). It regulates expression of
proinflammatory molecules MIP-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12. Unfortunately few studies have
examined the expression of HIF-1α i.1 and 1.2 so it is difficult to draw broad conclusions on
their impact. Although their existence has been recognized, the human splice variants have
received very little attention.

vii. HIF-1α in innate response to infection
HIF-1α accumulates following infection with a wide variety of pathogens. As mentioned
previously, this accrual may occur as a result of protein stabilization, transcriptional induction, or
both. The contribution of these mechanisms may alter the timing of induction as well as the
duration of the response. HIF-1α protein is elevated in response to group A Streptococcus
(GAS), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis and donovani, Aspergillus fumigatus, Yersinia
enterocolitica, and Helicobacter pylori (135, 139, 148, 153, 155, 177–183). Transcriptional
induction occurred in response to Helicobacter pylori, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Yersinia
enterocolitica while HIF-1α protein was stabilized in response to Yersinia enterocolitica (135,
155, 182, 183). The role of transcription and/or protein stabilization was not elucidated following
infection with the other listed pathogens. Although LPS-mediated transcriptional induction may
occur, the absence of HIF-1α induction in gram-negative Legionella pneumophila infection
demonstrates that this mechanism is not implicated in the immune response to all pathogens

28

(146). Critically, this and the absence of HIF-1α induction in response to LPS from B. henselae
as presented above suggests that differences in LPS content and/or structure may lead different
HIF-1α responses.
In response to most of these pathogens, HIF-1α is required for eradication and host
survival; however, at least three of these agents have co-opted HIF-1α to promote their
replication. Early H. capsulatum infection responses are predominated by immune cells of the
myeloid lineage. As such, observations of the involvement of HIF-1α within these cells are
described in detail below.

viii. HIF-1α in myeloid cells
In order to investigate the role of mouse HIF-1α, it was necessary to generate a
conditional knockout. Myeloid conditional knockout mice were generated utilizing the Cre-loxP
system. In this system, HIF-1α floxed mice were crossed with LysMcre mice. The resultant
Lyz2cre Hif1α fl/fl mice exhibit HIF-1α deletion within alveolar Ms, inflammatory monocytes,
monocyte-derived Ms, monocyte-derived DCs, PMNs and likely within alveolar type II cells
(178, 184). In all of the studies presented in the following chapters, Lyz2cre/cre Hif1α fl/fl mice
were utilized. These mice exhibit nearly complete deletion of HIF-1α , but also lack lysozyme 2
(178). While Lyz2cre/cre Hif1α fl/fl mice did not exhibit any phenotypic abnormalities under
normal conditions, they did exhibit profound changes in pathogen killing, cytokine production,
and cell motility following infection (178).
These mice allow the examination of HIF-1α function in the innate immune response to
infection. An effective innate response requires a variety of myeloid-specific cellular processes
29

including phagocytic uptake and production of antimicrobial mediators – including nitric oxide
as well as antimicrobial peptides and granule proteases (185). The impact of HIF-1α on
phagocytosis is unclear. Neutrophils exhibit elevated phagocytosis of E. coli when HIF-1α is
elevated (186). However, phagocyte uptake is not altered in response to Aspergillus fumigatus
when HIF-1α is deleted (155). While alterations in phagocytosis of other infectious pathogens
have not been examined, phagocytosis of opsonized red blood cells is enhanced in hypoxia
(187).
Following pathogen uptake, HIF-1α is important in phagocyte activation in response to
Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella
typhimurium (139, 178, 179). HIF-1α evokes direct killing of many pathogenic microbes by
primary mediators such as ROS, NO, and antimicrobial peptides (185, 188–190). Decreased
iNOS transcription and subsequently low NO have been implicated in diminished clearance in
myeloid HIF-1α knockouts. Following infection with GAS Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibit larger
necrotic ulcers and elevated bacterial loads compared to controls (185). During infection these
mice exhibit decreased transcription of iNOS and decreased nitrite release. Inhibition of iNOS in
bone marrow derived Ms was able to elevate intracellular GAS burden to a similar level as the
conditional knockout. iNOS was diminished in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice relative to controls
following infection with Salmonella typhimurium and Helicobacter pylori as well, but the impact
it had on pathogen restriction was not assessed (179, 183). Although NO may act as an
antimicrobial agent, its function in these infections is difficult to interpret since it may act a
signaling molecule (191). It may even enhance HIF-1α protein accumulation (192). If this is the
case even small differences in NO generation may lead to large changes in cellular activation
downstream of HIF-1α or other signaling pathways.
30

Recruitment and migration of immune cells to the site of infection are critical for
pathogen control. HIF-1α regulates this process through upregulation of adhesion molecules and
chemokines (185, 193). Following hypoxic stimulation, myelocytes exhibit enhanced binding to
activated endothelium dependent on β2 integrin (160). Following infection with Aspergillus
fumigatus, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice have decreased PMN migration to the lungs, which leads to an
elevated burden and decreased survival (155). However, the story may be more complicated
since Helicobacter pylori-infected Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibit elevated M migration to the
gastric mucosa relative to controls (183).
HIF-1α within myeloid cells is thus important in control of pathogen replication through
direct mechanisms as well as cell recruitment/migration to the site of infection. Phagocytic cell
types including Ms and PMNs play a key role in these innate immune responses to pathogens.
Some of the molecular targets of HIF-1α have been more extensively studied in these cells in the
setting of infection. Since our data will show that HIF-1α in PMNs is not essential for an
efficient immune response to H. capsulatum (see Chapter 2 page 72 for more detail), I have
elected to focus on the function of HIF-1α in Ms.

ix. HIF-1α in Ms
The function of HIF-1α in Ms has been studied extensively (141, 154, 165, 169, 170,
176, 178, 194–203). This work largely focuses on the response to hypoxia, but some recent work
examines this transcription factor in the response to pathogen associated molecular patterns such
as LPS or live pathogens. It is not currently clear if hypoxia and pathogen driven HIF-1α
induction evoke a differential response by the cell.

HIF-1α in hypoxic Ms
As early responders to infected tissues, circulating monocytes must be prepared for a
variety of microenvironments. The HIF-1α pathway allows for a rapid and robust response to
low oxygen levels through regulation of cellular glycolysis. In hypoxia, HIF-1α directly induces
expression of GLUT1 and glycolytic enzymes including 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase,
phosphoglycerate kinase 1, and pyruvate kinase M2 (204–206). These function to enhance
glucose uptake and glycolysis, which does not require oxygen for ATP production. Following
anaerobic glycolysis, the end product, pyruvate, is metabolized into lactate by lactate
dehydrogenase, another HIF-1α target (118, 207). Indeed HIF-1α-deficient Ms in hypoxia have
reduced ATP pools and lactate compared to control cells (178). As a result, energy-demanding
processes such as aggregation, migration, and invasion are impaired in the HIF-1α knockout Ms
(178).
In addition to a direct impact on energy availability, HIF-1α may be required for
functional maturation of Ms (195, 208). Classically activated M1 Ms are dependent on
glycolysis for ATP production while M2 Ms utilize oxidative phosphorylation (165). Recent
work has shown that HIF-1α and HIF-2α work in concert to drive M polarization by modulating
NO homeostasis and arginase 1 expression in response to Th1 and Th2 cytokines, respectively
(169). IFN-γ and/or LPS trigger M1 M differentiation; they are microbicidal in part due to
production of ROS and NO. They produce Th1 associated cytokines TNF-α and IL-12 (209). In
contrast, M2 Ms are associated with a Th2 response and produce IL-10, low levels of IL-12,
and reduced iNOS transcript (209). However, M1/M2 polarization is highly dependent on in
vitro stimulation conditions, and M in vivo display a continuum of functional states and a high

32

degree of plasticity (210, 211). Control of M polarization represents an additional avenue by
which HIF-1α directs the innate immune response.
HIF-1α is required for M migration, chemokine-driven recruitment, and M aggregation
in the setting of hypoxia (178). HIF-1α regulates the hypoxia-driven expression of the
chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is important for myeloid cell recruitment as well as the
recruiting chemokine and cytokines CXCL8, IL-1β, and VEGF (208, 212, 213). Additional
targets include the integrins CD18, CD11b, and β2, which are necessary for diapedesis (160,
214, 215).
Once to the site of inflammation, HIF-1α is essential for phagocytosis as well as
production of proteins associated with microbicidal activity. Hypoxia induced HIF-1α was
critical for uptake of opsonized sheep red blood cells as well as E. coli (200). Following
phagocytosis, production of iNOS and TNF-α is important for an effective phagocyte response to
infection; hypoxia-driven M manufacturing of these proteins is also dependent on this
transcription factor (185). Control of these processes allows the cell to persist in an “off” state
prior to migration to the site of infection while low oxygen levels can rapidly activate a
phagocytic response.

Effects of pathogen-induced HIF-1α
Since HIF-1α positively regulates M polarization, migration, and phagocytosis in
hypoxia, it could be hypothesized that it is critical for an effective host response to infection.
Although it is important for bacterial killing and inflammatory cytokine production in response
to some infectious agents, other pathogens have evolved to exploit this transcription factor.

33

HIF-1α deficient Ms have an impaired capacity to kill gram positive and gram negative
bacteria compared to wild-type cells (178, 185). In response to GAS, this defective killing is due
to decreased iNOS expression and NO release (185). Although the mechanism was not
elucidated, HIF-1α knockout Ms exhibited elevated burden following in vitro infection with
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) compared to controls (178). While most studies did not examine
phagocytosis, a defect in uptake was not noted between HIF-1α sufficient and deficient Ms in
response to GBS or the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus (155, 178).
Intracellular pathogens Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania species, and Chlamydia
pneumoniae require M HIF-1α for replication. Toxoplasma inhibits PHD2 expression and
activity to elevate HIF-1α protein (153, 180). Leishmania depletes cellular iron to inhibit PHD
activity (182). The mechanism these agents utilize to subvert the immune response has not been
thoroughly elucidated. Although the mechanism by which Chlamydia enhances HIF-1α was not
studied, HIF-1α-dependent cellular glucose elevation during early infection, which it presumably
acquires for its own metabolism, was critical for pathogen growth (148). Paradoxically,
Chlamydia secretes the proteolytic protein CPAF during prolonged infection to degrade HIF-1α
(148). While the effect of maintained HIF-1α was not examined, this suggests that the
downstream targets of HIF-1α are ultimately detrimental to pathogen growth.
In most of the infectious models to studied, M pro-inflammatory cytokine production is
largely dependent on HIF-1α. This transcription factor is necessary for LPS-induced M
production of TNF-α, IL-12, IL-1α, and IL-1β although it is not required for IL-10 or IL-4 (139).
GAS-induced TNF-α also requires HIF-1α (185). Even though HIF-1α is not essential for H.
pylori eradication, it is needed for production of IL-1β and IL-6 during infection (183). While

34

indirect effects cannot be ruled out, HREs exist in the promoters for many of these targets
including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 (139, 216, 217).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that M HIF-1α is an important regulator of the
innate response to infectious agents. HIF-1α controls production of the antimicrobial molecule
NO and Th1 associated inflammatory cytokines. While activation of the HIF-1α pathway is
generally beneficial for the host, some pathogens are able to exploit this by skewing Ms toward
a suboptimal immune response.

35

Synopsis
The function of the transcription factor HIF-1α in response to hypoxia has been
extensively studied since its discovery over 20 years ago. However, research focusing on the
mechanisms of normoxic HIF-1α induction as well as those that attempt to elucidate the role by
which the host and pathogens utilize HIF-1α has only just begun. Many important questions
about the mechanism of induction and the function of this transcription factor in the immune
response remain.
The work presented in the following chapters investigates three main hypotheses: (i)
myeloid HIF-1α is required for mouse control of the fungal pathogen H. capsulatum, (ii) HIF-1α
regulates immune cell recruitment and cytokine production following infection, and (iii) HIF-1α
elevation in response to this fungal pathogen is the result of protein stabilization and
transcriptional induction.
In Chapter 2, we investigate the first two hypotheses by infecting myeloid specific HIF1α knockout mice (Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl) with H. capsulatum. The absence of myeloid HIF-1α
decreased survival and increased fungal burden. Contrary to our hypothesis, the collapse of
immunity was not associated with a reduction in lung pro-inflammatory protective cytokines, but
rather with an elevation in IL-10. We go on to examine the mechanism of IL-10 induction and
the role of this cytokine in the elevated fungal burden and decreased survival seen in HIF-1α
deficiency.
In Chapter 3, we lay the ground work to assess the role of transcriptional induction in
HIF-1α elevation. We demonstrate that a soluble mediator released by infected Ms is able to
induce HIF-1α and its downstream target genes. We provide evidence that TNF-α is one such

36

soluble mediator. In the discussion we build on this knowledge and provide future studies that
will help to elucidate the mechanism(s) of HIF-1α elevation following infection.
In Chapter 4, we provide RNA-seq data obtained from both control and HIF-1α deficient
Ms prior to and after infection with H. capsulatum. This data suggested that expression of
miR27a may be involved in regulating IL-10 expression. We expect that the information
obtained in this chapter will provide additional insight into the immune response to H.
capsulatum both in the setting of HIF-1α deficiency as well as when endogenous HIF-1α is
present.
Taken together, these studies uncover novel insight into the function of HIF-1α in Ms
following infection and suggest an important role in regulation of IL-10 production. Our working
model incorporates the facets that we have noted as well as the hypotheses we present in the
discussion of this thesis (Fig. 1.4).

37

Fig 1.4 Proposed model
Macrophage recognition of H. capsulatum via CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and dectin-1 may enhance HIF-1α either directly
via NO/ROS mediated stabilization or via Syk signaling driven transcriptional induction. Transcriptional induction
occurs via a soluble mediator, such as TNF-α or IL-1β. These cytokines can then act in an autocrine or paracrine
manner to enhance HIF-1α transcription. In the absence of HIF-1α, CREB is able to bind to CBP to enhance IL-10
production, which reduces M activation and ultimately leads to elevated fungal burden and mouse death.

Abstract
Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is a transcription factor that regulates metabolic and immune
response genes in the setting of low oxygen tension and inflammation. We investigated the
function of HIF-1α in the host response to Histoplasma capsulatum since granulomas induced by
this pathogenic fungus develop hypoxic microenvironments during the early adaptive immune
response. Here we demonstrated that myeloid HIF-1α-deficient mice exhibited elevated fungal
burden during the innate immune response (prior to seven days post-infection) as well as
decreased survival in response to a sublethal inoculum of H. capsulatum. The absence of
myeloid HIF-1α did not alter immune cell recruitment to the lungs of infected animals but was
associated with an elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Treatment with mAb to IL10 restored protective immunity to the mutant mice. Macrophages (M) constituted the majority
of IL-10 producing cells. Deletion of HIF-1α in neutrophils or DCs did not alter fungal burden
thus implicating Ms as the pivotal cell in host resistance. HIF-1α was stabilized in Ms
following infection. Increased activity of the transcription factor CREB in HIF-1α-deficient Ms
drove IL-10 production in response to H. capsulatum. IL-10 inhibited M control of fungal
growth in response to the activating cytokine IFN-γ. Thus, we identified a critical function for
M HIF-1α in tempering IL-10 production following infection. We established that
transcriptional regulation of IL-10 by HIF-1α and CREB is critical for activation of M by IFN-γ
and effective handling of H. capsulatum.

Introduction
H. capsulatum is the most common endemic pulmonary mycosis in the United States (1).
While immunocompetent hosts typically resolve infection with minimal symptoms, severe
infections can develop in immunocompromised individuals. Coordinated activity of the innate
and adaptive immune systems is required for fungal growth restriction. Early innate recognition
is required for phagocytosis, cytokine production, and recruitment of additional innate cells and
adaptive cells. This accumulation and signaling drive development of granulomas. During the
initiation of adaptive immunity, granulomas become hypoxic; one of the central transcription
factors in the response to hypoxia is HIF-1α (2).
HIF-1 is a multi-subunit transcription factor composed of a constitutively expressed β
subunit, HIF-1β/ARNT, and an oxygen labile α subunit, HIF-1α (3). The oxygen-dependent
degradation of HIF-1α is controlled via hydroxylation of the oxygen-dependent degradation
(ODD) domain (3). Oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing (PHD) enzymes
are responsible for hydroxylation of the ODD in the setting of low oxygen (4). Subsequent
polyubiquitination leads to recognition by the 26S proteasome and degradation (5, 6). The
requirement for O2 as an essential co-factor drives decreased activity in the setting of hypoxia,
which is responsible for elevated HIF-1α protein.
Infection with a variety of pathogens has been associated with increased HIF-1α protein
and/or expression of downstream targets. LPS can induce HIF-1α expression through increased
transcription rather than protein stabilization in the setting of normoxia (7–10). While the
mechanism of HIF-1α protein stabilization and/or transcriptional induction is unknown, it
accumulates in the setting of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Vesicular Stomatitis virus,
Hepatitis B and C, Human Papilloma Virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis, and
59

the fungal pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans (11–19). These studies suggest
that, while HIF-1α plays an undeniable role in the cellular response to hypoxia, it may have been
co-opted as a transcription factor in the response to pathogens as well.
HIF-1α regulates numerous genes involved in both innate and adaptive immune
responses. This transcription factor has been implicated as a key element in phagocyte and T cell
function in response to a wide variety of pathogens (20). In infectious diseases, HIF-1α targets
within phagocytes include microbicidal genes as well as soluble mediators that recruit and
activate immune cells (21). HIF-1α evokes direct killing of many pathogenic microbes by
primary mediators such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide (NO), and antimicrobial peptides
(22–25). Direct targets of HIF-1α in myeloid cells include the pro-inflammatory molecules TNFα, IL-12, and CCL2 as well as the anti-inflammatory IL-10 (26–29).
IL-10 inhibits antimicrobial activity of M by limiting production of inflammatory
cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (30–32). In the innate
response to H. capsulatum, IL-10 dampens immunity by limiting IFN-γ production; IL-10-/- mice
exhibit elevated IFN-γ in association with accelerated H. capsulatum clearance (33). Modulation
of IFN-γ by IL-10 attenuates the activation of M, which need IFN-γ to kill H. capsulatum (34).
Although IL-10 is produced by multiple cell populations, myeloid cells are the predominant
producer during H. capsulatum infection (35).
The presence of hypoxia and the prominence of HIF-1α in dictating antimicrobial
activity, metabolism, and cytokine generation led us to consider the contribution of this
transcription factor in the myeloid response to H. capsulatum infection. To this end, we infected
myeloid specific HIF-1α knockout mice (Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl) via the pulmonary route with H.
capsulatum. The absence of myeloid HIF-1α decreased survival and increased fungal burden as
60

early as day 3 post-infection. The collapse of immunity was not associated with a reduction in
lung pro-inflammatory protective cytokines, but rather with an elevation in IL-10. Ms, the
principal source of this cytokine, were the dominant myeloid cell population required for the
phenotype of the mutant mice. M production of IL-10 was tempered by HIF-1α and depended
on enhanced CREB-binding protein (CBP)-driven transcriptional induction. Elevated IL-10 from
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl M prevented IFN-γ driven activation and, thus, enhanced fungal burden
relative to control M. These results demonstrate that HIF-1α is critical for controlling the
progression of infection with the fungal pathogen H. capsulatum by limiting IL-10.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Male C57BL/6 and breeding pairs of Itgax-cre (C57BL/6 background) mice were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). We thank Dr. Timothy Eubank, Ohio State
University, for the Hif1αfl/fl, Lyz2cre, and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice. Itgaxcre and Hif1αfl/fl mice were
crossed to generate Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl mice. We thank Gang Huang, Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center, for Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl Hif2αfl/fl. Animals were housed in isolator cages
and maintained by the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, University of Cincinnati,
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All
animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act guidelines of
the National Institutes of Health, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati.

Preparation of H. capsulatum and infection of mice
H. capsulatum strain G217B and yeast cells of the same strain that express GFP were grown for
72 h at 37 oC as described (36, 37). To infect mice, 6–8 week-old animals were inoculated
intranasally with 2x106 yeasts or 2x107 yeasts (indicated as high dose) in ~30 µl of Hank’s
Balanced Salt Solution (HyClone, Logan, UT). For in vitro infection, cells were allowed to
adhere to plates for 3 h. Cells were infected with 1-5 yeast per M for the indicated times.

Generation of bone marrow-derived Ms (BMDMs) and in vitro inhibition
Bone marrow was isolated from tibiae and femurs of 6–10-week-old mice by flushing with
HBSS. Cells were dispensed into tissue culture flasks at a density of 1x10 6 cells/ml of RPMI62

1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, 5 µM 2mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml of mouse GM-CSF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Flasks were
incubated at 37 oC in 5% CO2. Ms were harvested at day 7. Non-adherent cells were removed,
ice-cold PBS was added, and cells were scraped from the flask. Cells were collected, washed
with PBS, and dispensed into culture dishes. For inhibition studies, piceatannol (Tocris, Bristol,
UK) was added to Ms 90 minutes before infection. For CBP interaction inhibition studies,
chetomin (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) was added to Ms 30 minutes prior to infection and KG501
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added 90 minutes before infection.

RNA Isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA from whole lungs of mice was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
from in vitro M cultures using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Oligo(dT)-primed
cDNA was prepared by using the reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Madison, WI).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan master
mixture and primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were analyzed with ABI
Prism 7500. The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase housekeeping gene was used as an
internal control. The conditions for amplification were 50 oC for 2 min and 95oC for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95oC for 15 sec and 60oC for 1 min.

Isolation of lung leukocytes
Lungs were homogenized with the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in
5ml of HBSS with 2 mg/ml of collagenase D (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 40U of DNase I
(Roche) for 30 min at 37oC. The homogenate was percolated through a 40 mm nylon mesh

63

(Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and washed three times with HBSS.
Leukocytes were isolated by separation on Lympholyte M (Cedarlane, Burlington, ON).

Western blot
Following 24 h of infection, non-adherent cells were washed off with ice cold PBS. Cells were
scraped off in ice cold PBS and spun down. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were
separated by electrophoresis in SDS/PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The
membranes were used for immunodetection of HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and β
actin (Santa Cruz).

Confocal microscopy
Following 24 h of infection, BMDMs were stained with HIF-1α antibody and DAPI nuclear
stain for 30 min. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal and analyzed with ZEN
2011 software.

Organ culture for H. capsulatum
Organs were homogenized in sterile HBSS, serially diluted, and plated onto mycosel-agar plates
containing 5% sheep blood and 5% glucose. Plates were incubated at 30 oC for 7 days. The limit
of detection was 102 CFU.

Flow cytometry, cell sorting, and gating strategy
Cells from mouse lungs were incubated with CD16/32 to limit nonspecific binding. Leukocytes
were then stained with the indicated antibodies at 4oC for 15-30 min in phosphate-buffered saline

64

containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were stained with
combinations of the following antibodies: FITC-conjugated Ly6G; FITC-conjugated Ly6C;
FITC-conjugated CD11c; PerCP-conjugated CD11b; APC-conjugated CD3; PE-conjugated
CD4; FITC-conjugated CD8; and APC-conjugated F4/80 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For
intracellular IL-10 staining, cells were incubated with Cytofix/ Cytoperm (BD Biosciences),
washed in Permeabilization Buffer (BD Biosciences), and stained for 45 min with PE-conjugated
IL-10 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were washed and resuspended in 1%
paraformaldehyde. Isotype controls were used. Data were acquired using BD Accuri C6
cytometer and analyzed using the FCS Express 4.0 Software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles,
CA). For cell sorting experiments, leukocytes from the lungs of Lyz2cre and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl
mice were isolated at day 3 or day 7 post-infection using 5 laser FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences)
following cell surface staining. Cells were identified using side (SSC-A) and forward scatter
(FSC-A), followed by doublet exclusion using forward scatter height (FSC-H) against FSC-A.
Cells were subsequently phenotypically characterized by the following surface markers:
neutrophils (PMNs) were Ly-6Ghi, CD11b+, F4/80-; dendritic cells (DCs) were F4/80 -, CD11b-/+,
CD11c+; M were F4/80+, CD11c-, CD11b+; CD4 T cells were CD3+, CD4+, CD8-; CD8 T cells
were CD3+, CD4-, CD8+. As gated here, the M population does not include interstitial M or
alveolar M. Gating strategy depicted in Supplemental Fig. 1.

PMN depletion and IL-4 and IL-10 neutralization
PMNs were depleted by i.p. injection of anti-Ly6G mAb (1A8), containing 0.1 mg protein, 24 h
prior to infection, and at days 1, 3, and 5 post-infection. PMN depletion was confirmed by flow
cytometry staining for Ly6G/C (Nimp14), CD11b, and CD11c in experimental animals. IL-4 was

65

neutralized by i.p. injections of anti-IL-4 (11B11), containing 1 mg protein, at the time of
infection and at day 3 post-infection. IL-10 was neutralized by i.p. injections of anti-IL-10
(JES5-2A5), containing 0.25 mg protein, at the time of infection, and at days 3, 5, and 7 postinfection. Control mice were treated with an equivalent quantity of IgG antibody.

Histology
Lungs were inflated, excised, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections
(5 µm) were stained with H&E. Serial pictures were obtained on an Olympus BX51 microscope
and Olympus DP71 camera. Lung sections were reconstructed using Photoshop Photomerge CS5
(Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Area of inflammation was measured using the measure function
in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) in a blinded fashion.

Measurement of cytokines
Cytokines were quantified in lung homogenates and cell-free M culture supernatants using a
Milliplex MAP immunoassay (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following an overnight incubation with
the assay beads according to the manufacturer protocol. A minimum of 100 beads were counted
for each analyte per well. The beads were analyzed on a Luminex Magpix instrument (Luminex
Corporation, Austin, TX) using Luminex xPONENT software. Additional analysis was
performed utilizing the Milliplex Analyst (Millipore) software.

Griess assay

66

The quantity of NO in the supernatant of cultured bone marrow derived macrophages was
measured using the Griess Reagent System. Briefly, sample aliquots were mixed with an equal
volume of Griess reagent (l% sulfanilamide/0.1% naphthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride/2 %
H3PO4). A microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 540 nm (BioTek
Instruments, Inc., Burlington, VT). NO2- was determined using NaNO2 as a standard. Media
background was determined and subtracted from the experimental values. Nitrate was converted
into nitrite prior to the reaction with Griess reagent, since nitrite is rapidly oxidized to nitrate.

Statistics
Statistical p values were calculated with one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons and
adjusted with Bonferroni’s or Holm Sidak correction and nonpaired Student’s t test where two
groups were compared; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant

Results
Myeloid HIF-1α is required for fungal clearance and survival following infection with H.
capsulatum.
Since HIF-1α regulates production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to
be essential in response to H. capsulatum, we sought to determine the necessity of this
transcription factor within the myeloid cell compartment (38, 39). Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibit
HIF-1α deletion within alveolar Ms, inflammatory monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and
PMNs (38). We infected control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice with a sublethal number of H.
capsulatum yeast cells. As early as 10 days post-infection, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice began to
succumb to infection; by 30 days, over 90% of them died while all control Lyz2cre mice and
Hif1αfl/fl mice survived (Fig. 1A). To assess if the decreased survival in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
was associated with an enhanced fungal burden, we measured the number of organisms in lungs
at 1, 3, and 7 days post-infection. Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibited a striking increase in fungal
burden relative to controls as early as 3 days and through 7 days post-infection (Fig. 1B).
Cell recruitment and expansion are unaltered in HIF-1α knockout mice.
To elucidate any alterations in the organization of the inflammatory response, we
evaluated the amount of inflammation in histopathology sections of lung tissue from infected
control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice at 3 and 7 days post-infection (Fig. 1C). At day 3, both control
and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibited acute peribronchiolar inflammation; the area of involvement
in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice was increased relative to control mice (Fig. 1D). By 7 days the
inflammation had coalesced into consolidation in both groups; there was no difference in the area
between control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.

68

While we saw no change in the inflamed area at day 7, we speculated that the lack of
HIF-1α might alter specific leukocyte populations since it is required for optimal immune cell
recruitment (18, 38, 40). To examine the composition of inflammatory cell populations, we
stained lungs at days 3 and 7 post-infection for Ms, PMNs, DCs, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Absolute cell numbers in each of these populations were unaltered relative to control at 3 days
post-infection (Fig. 1E). PMNs were elevated at day 7 post-infection, but the numbers of other
populations were similar between the two groups of mice (Fig. 1F). These results suggested that
cell recruitment and expansion following infection do not explain the elevated fungal burden and
decreased survival of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.

Lack of HIF-1α in myeloid cells enhances production of IL-10.
Since inflammatory cell recruitment was not deficient in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice, we
surveyed cytokines that are known to be important in the murine response to H. capsulatum in
lung homogenates at 3 and 7 days post-infection. Relative to controls, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl murine
lungs exhibited an elevation in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 as well as prototypically
protective cytokines IFN-γ and IL-1β as early as day 3 post-infection (Fig. 2A) (36, 41, 42). No
change in TNF-α or GM-CSF between the two groups was observed on day 3 post-infection or in
any cytokines prior to infection (Fig. 2A, data not shown). At 7 days of infection, the lungs of
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice manifested elevated production of IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-1β, GM-CSF and IL-4
(Fig. 2B). The IL-10 concentration at day 7 post-infection in lungs of the Itgaxcre mice (202 ±
13 pg/mL, n=4) did not differ (p>0.05) from that of infected controls (197 ± 6 pg/mL, n=8).
While IL-4 is known to inhibit the immune response to H. capsulatum, elevation of this
cytokine subsequent to the rise in fungal burden suggested that it was a consequence rather than
69

a driver of the altered immune response in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (43, 44). To determine the
contribution of IL-4 to the phenotype of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice we administered mAb to this
cytokine both prior to and during the course of infection. Since murine survival was unaltered in
these mice, we concluded that IL-4 elevation was not responsible for the phenotype of Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A).
One concern in interpreting the elevation in cytokines in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice is that the
higher fungal burden may have enhanced production. To test this assertion, we infected control
animals with a one log higher inoculum of H. capsulatum; this number of yeasts replicated the
fungal burden in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (Fig. 2C). We measured cytokines in lung homogenates
following instillation of the lower and higher number of yeast cells at 7 days post-infection. The
exaggerated fungal burden in control mice increased IFN-γ and IL-1β cytokine production
comparable to the amount in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice while TNF-α was unaltered (Fig. 2D).
However, the quantity of IL-10 in the heavily infected controls did not differ from that of mice
that received the lower inoculum (Fig. 2D). Thus, the high fungal burden was not the driving
force in amplified IL-10 in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice. This finding demonstrates that the enhanced
IL-10 production in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice is a consequence of HIF-1α deficiency while the
heightened pathogen burden in these mice caused the increase in proinflammatory cytokines.
Since IL-10 was augmented early during infection, we examined its influence on the
fungal burden and survival of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice. Anti-IL-10 mAb given to Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl
and control mice reduced fungal burden compared to IgG control in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice and
enhanced survival (Fig. 2E, 2F, and Supplemental Fig. 4).

70

Ms are the primary IL-10 producing cells from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice following infection
with H. capsulatum.
We sought to determine the primary IL-10 producing cell populations within the lungs of
infected mice. We inoculated control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice with H. capsulatum and
performed intracellular IL-10 staining within several immune cell populations including Ms at
days 3 and 7. Representative flow cytometry plots demonstrate IL-10 staining in myeloid cells at
day 7 post-infection (Fig. 3A). Prior to infection, intracellular IL-10 is not detectable in control
or Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (data not shown). At day 3, multiple myeloid populations produced IL10, but Ms constituted the majority of IL-10+ cells in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
(Fig. 3B). Likewise, at day 7, Ms still constituted the most numerous IL-10 producers in both
groups (Fig. 3D). Relative to controls, the number of IL-10+ PMNs, DCs, and Ms isolated from
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice at day 3 were increased, whereas at day 7 post-infection more IL-10+ lung
Ms and T cells were present in the mutant mice (Fig. 3B and 3D). There was no change
between the two groups in the IL-10 MFI in any of the cell populations at either day 3 or day 7
post-infection (Fig. 3C and 3E). Thus, M are the most numerous IL-10 producing cell
population in response to H. capsulatum. The increase in IL-10 found in the lungs was most
likely a consequence of more cells rather than inflated production at the single cell level since
MFIs did not vary between identical cell populations from the two groups of mice.

Loss of M HIF-1α is responsible for the survival defect in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice exhibit HIF-1α deletion in all myeloid cells. In order to hone in on
the cell population(s) responsible for the survival defect within mutant mice, we generated
Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl mice. In these mice HIF-1α is eliminated in alveolar Ms and tissue resident
71

and monocyte-derived DCs (45). We infected control, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl, and Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl
mice with a sublethal number of H. capsulatum yeast cells. As observed previously the vast
majority of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice succumbed to infection while all control and Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl
mice survived (Fig. 4A). These results suggested that HIF-1α in alveolar Ms and DCs was
dispensable for survival following H. capsulatum infection. Thus, we can infer that the presence
of this transcription factor in PMNs or Ms was required to confer protective immunity.
We sought to directly address the impact of PMN HIF-1α. Studies that examine the
necessity of PMNs in H. capsulatum by depleting them suggest that they are essential for
protective immunity (46, 47). However, these reports utilize an antibody (clone RB6) that
recognizes both Ly6G and Ly6C. Since the latter is expressed on PMNs and inflammatory
monocytes, it is difficult to discriminate which of these populations is responsible for the
aggressive infection in mice. We therefore sought to clarify the contribution of PMNs by
depleting these cells in both wild type and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice with a Ly6G specific antibody.
Following administration of 1A8 mAb or isotype control mAb, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl and wild type
mice were infected for 7 days. The loss of PMNs was confirmed by differential lung leukocyte
count (Fig. 4B). The lack of PMNs did not elevate the fungal burden in either control mice or
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (Fig. 4C). Since PMNs were dispensable for fungal clearance, we
concluded that these cells did not contribute to the phenotype observed in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
via either HIF-1α-dependent or independent mechanisms. These results demonstrate that M
HIF-1α was required for murine survival. The importance of this population is consistent with
our prior data that IL-10 contributes to the phenotype of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice and that M are
the primary producer of IL-10 in these mice.

72

Infection with H. capsulatum drives HIF-1α transcription and protein nuclear localization
within Ms.
The accumulated data strongly implicated HIF-1α deficiency within Ms as the critical
node for the elevated fungal burden and decreased survival in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice. To assess
transcriptional induction of HIF-1α as well as several downstream targets including vascular
endothelial growth factor (Vegf-a) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk-1) in vivo, we infected
animals with H. capsulatum expressing GFP and sorted infected pulmonary Ms (F4/80+
CD11b+ CD11c- GFP+ or GFP-) at 1, 3, and 7 days post-infection. Infected cells exhibited
transcriptional upregulation of Hif-1α, Vegf-a, and Pgk-1 (Fig. 5A).
Evidence of other microbes driving HIF-1α led us to inquire whether H. capsulatum
infection induces HIF-1α in the absence of hypoxia (8, 48–50). Accordingly, we infected control
and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs for 24 h and assessed the transcription of Hif-1α and its
downstream targets; Hif-1α and Pgk-1 were induced over 5 fold while Vegf-a was induced over
10 fold in a HIF-1α dependent manner (Fig. 5B). We assessed expression of CD11b on M
because it is the principal phagocytic receptor and it is regulated by HIF-1α: this integrin was not
altered in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl cells in vitro or in vivo (51, 52) (Supplemental Fig. 3A and 3B).
To directly assess HIF-1α protein stabilization and cellular localization, we utilized
uninfected cells or cells infected for 24 h from both control and HIF-1α-deficient BMDMs and
analyzed protein expression and localization via western blot and confocal microscopy,
respectively. Western blot analysis demonstrated HIF-1α protein in infected Lyz2cre cells, but no
HIF-1α was detected in infected cells from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (Fig. 5C). Confocal
microscopic analysis demonstrated that HIF-1α was located within the nucleus following
infection of wild type but not Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs with H. capsulatum (Fig. 5D). We
73

concluded that H. capsulatum infection causes HIF-1α upregulation and translocation to the
nucleus where it can modulate downstream targets.

The transcription factor CREB, in the absence of HIF-1α, drives elevated IL-10 production
in response to H. capsulatum infection.
Since HIF-1α has been shown to positively regulate IL-10 production, the increase in this
cytokine found in the lungs of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice was unexpected (53). To investigate the
mechanism of IL-10 production, we infected control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs for 24 and
48 h. Fungal burdens at 48 h were not different between control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs
(Fig. 6A). We quantified IL-10 in the cell culture supernatants; Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl derived Ms
secreted nearly twice as much IL-10 only at 48 h (Fig. 6B). This elevation was associated with a
concomitant enhancement in IL-10 transcription in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs compared to
control (Fig. 6C).
Competition between transcription factors for a limiting supply of CBP has been shown
to regulate IL-10 production (54). Therefore we hypothesized that the absence of HIF-1α
resulted in increased HIF-2α binding to CBP and subsequent elevation in IL-10 protein (55, 56).
To test this postulate we infected BMDMs from controls, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice, and Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl Hif2αfl/fl double knockout mice for 24 h and examined IL-10 protein in supernatants.
The quantity of IL-10 in the absence of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α exceeded that of cells from
control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice (Fig. 6D).
We then examined the function of CREB, another transcription factor known to bind
CBP and drive IL-10 transcription (57). To test the contribution of CREB and HIF-1α on IL-10
production, we treated wild type BMDMs with small molecule inhibitors that prevent CREB
74

(KG-501) or HIF-1α (chetomin) association with CBP. KG-501, but not chetomin, inhibited IL10 transcription in response to H. capsulatum infection (Fig. 6E). KG-501 also decreased IL-10
protein during infection with H. capsulatum (Fig. 6F).
To address the concern of off-target effects of the inhibitor, we utilized siRNA to reduce
CREB in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs. CREB knockdown reduced transcription
of IL-10 in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs (Fig. 6G). These results demonstrate
that CREB is important for IL-10 production in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs, but
the presence of HIF-1α tempers IL-10 levels.

Elevated IL-10 production by Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs inhibits IFN-γ induced fungal
control.
Since Ms are the primary IL-10 producing cell and one of the primary sites of
phagocytosis, we queried the number of these cells infected following administration of GFP + H.
capsulatum. There was an increase in infected cells from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice relative to
controls with no alteration in GFP MFI within the infected cells (Figure 7A and 7B; data not
shown). This finding implied that M from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice were more permissive for
intracellular invasion that was not a consequence of altered expression of CD11b. Hence we
asked if the M from the mutant mice were less responsive to an exogenous activating signal
such as IFN-γ. IL-10 is known to inhibit the capacity of Ms to respond to IFN-γ (58). To
address responsiveness of Ms to activating cytokine we infected wild type and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl
BMDMs with GFP+ H. capsulatum for up to 72 h with or without the addition of IFN-γ. While
cytokine activation decreased the percentage of infected control BMDMs, this signal did not

75

alter the infection of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs (Fig. 7C). Administration of anti-IL-10 at the
time of infection enabled IFN-γ mediated activation of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs (Fig. 7D).
Taken together our results suggest that elevated IL-10 from HIF-1α deficient-Ms inhibits IFN-γ
responsiveness that is required for effective fungal clearance.

Profiles of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.
HIF-1α evokes direct killing of many pathogenic microbes by primary mediators such as
nitric oxide (22, 24). Decreased iNOS transcription and subsequently low nitric oxide levels have
been implicated in diminished clearance of group A Streptococcus and Mycobacterium marinum
in the setting of HIF-1α deficiency (22). Inhibition of iNOS in both of these models was able to
elevate pathogen burden. To determine if NO was critically altered in HIF-1α deficiency, we first
assessed the ability of H. capsulatum to evoke iNOS in bone marrow derived macrophages.
Although infection led to iNOS induction in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl cells, it was
significantly reduced in the absence of HIF-1α (Fig. 8A). However, NO production was
unaltered in the absence of HIF-1α (Fig. 8B).
Since IFN-γ activates murine macrophages to inhibit H. capsulatum growth through
stimulation of nitric oxide generation, we activated and infected bone marrow derived
macrophages (59, 60). Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl and control cells secreted similar quantities of nitrite
(Fig. 8C).
Finally we examined iNOS induction in vivo. During early infection, iNOS was not
detectable in whole lung homogenates (Fig. 8D). iNOS is elevated at day 3 post-infection in both
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl and control mice (Fig. 8D). By day 7 post-infection, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
express more iNOS than controls (Fig. 8D). These results suggest that diminished NO production
76

in the absence of HIF-1α is not responsible for the elevated fungal burden and diminished
survival of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.

77

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that the transcription factor HIF-1α in the myeloid cell
compartment was a central molecular regulator of the protective immune response to H.
capsulatum. Its absence in these cells produced a progressive infection that led to the death of the
vast majority of animals. The principal defect was not an alteration in the inflammatory response
but rather an early and striking elevation in IL-10. Despite an abundance of cytokines known to
enhance immunity, IL-10 overrode their impact on host resistance. Immunity was restored when
this cytokine was neutralized by mAb to this cytokine. Since the exaggerated production of IL10 was detected prior to the onset of an adaptive immune response to H.capsulatum, we
surmised that its impact influenced innate immunity (61). The principal source of IL-10 was M
thus localizing impaired immunity to this specific population. Two findings provided additional
evidence that Ms were the cause of the collapse of immunity rather than another myeloid cell
population. First, elimination of PMNs in both control and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice did not alter
fungal burden. Second, Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl mice which exhibit selective deletion in tissue and
resident DCs and alveolar M survived the sublethal challenge. The unexpected elevation in IL10 by HIF-1α-deficient M is not caused by HIF-2α but is largely driven by CREB. In vitro
studies revealed that anti-IL-10 neutralization reversed the failure of M from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl
mice to respond to IFN-γ-mediated activation.
While HIF-1α is classically described as a key element in the cell response to hypoxia,
mounting evidence over the past decade has described its requirement in the immune response to
several pathogens; often, HIF-1α is required for phagocyte activation and killing, but
occasionally it is co-opted by the pathogen to promote intracellular survival (18, 20, 25, 62, 63).
As a requisite factor for protective immunity exerted by M, HIF-1α has been shown to regulate
78

production of cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial molecules (22, 24, 28, 39, 64, 65). Thus,
in the context of infection, HIF-1α target genes within phagocytes and M in particular can be
organized into two categories: one is production of soluble mediators that recruit and activate
other populations of immune cells and two, regulation of microbicidal activity by cells exposed
to pathogens.
Multiple pathogens are known to induce the transcription or stabilization of HIF-1α
protein even in the absence of hypoxia (11, 16, 18, 19, 25, 66, 67). Accordingly, H. capsulatuminfected M promoted expression of HIF-1α protein as demonstrated by western blot. The robust
transcriptional induction of HIF-1α protein leads to an elevation in both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm, which likely represents a massive accumulation with a delay prior to nuclear
translocation. We confirmed the in vitro induction results with in vivo studies in which sorted
lung M from wild-type mice transcribed the gene at day 7 post-infection, but not earlier. This
finding does not correspond to the temporal identification of poor control of fungal burden in the
mutant mice which begins on day 3. Although we could not detect by transcription a change in
HIF-1α prior to day 7, clearly its impact precedes transcriptional upregulation. The likely
explanation is that H. capsulatum stimulates protein stabilization prior to transcriptional
induction.
We anticipated a role for myeloid HIF-1α in shaping the adaptive immune response to
murine histoplasmosis since hypoxia is detected within liver granulomas induced by i.p. injection
of yeast cells (2). However, protective immunity was subverted in the Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
prior to the onset of adaptive immunity. These data indicated that a maladaptive innate response
led to the phenotype of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.

79

To hone in on the innate immune cell population responsible for the defective immune
response in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice, we evaluated the contribution of various myeloid lineage
cells. Ms, alveolar Ms, PMNs, and resident DCs are important for phagocytosis of yeast cells
following infection (51, 68, 69). These cells release cytokines and chemokines that facilitate
mobilization of the inflammatory response to combat invasion by H. capsulatum. Since Itgaxcre
Hif1αfl/fl mice did not manifest impaired survival we conclude that HIF-1α within DCs and
alveolar Ms is dispensable following H. capsulatum infection. The fact that elimination of
PMNs from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice did not alter fungal burden signifies that HIF-1α deficiency in
this population was not a contributor to the failed protective immune response. Our data with
PMN depletion contradicts prior studies whose results strongly suggest that PMNs are essential
for H. capsulatum clearance (46, 47). However, those studies employed the antibody RB6 which
is now known to recognize Ly-6G and Ly-6C. The latter is borne by inflammatory monocytes
(70). Therefore it is quite likely that in those experiments both PMNs and inflammatory
monocytes were depleted. The mAb that we employed, 1A8, is considered to be more selective
for Ly-6G (70).
The pivotal contribution of HIF-1α in response to H. capsulatum was not to drive
inflammatory cytokine production, but rather to temper IL-10. This finding is quite unexpected
since HIF-1α binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) that exist in the promoters for several
cytokines and chemokines important in the myeloid response to H. capsulatum including TNF-α,
CCL2, and IL-10 (71–73). The loss of HIF-1α did not reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine
production or cell recruitment to the lungs following infection. In fact, there was an increase in
several of these prototypically protective cytokines in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl lungs relative to control.
These data contrast with infectious models in which decreased myeloid pro-inflammatory

80

cytokine production is noted in the absence of HIF-1α; however, our data are congruent with a
study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice where the lack of HIF-1α in myeloid cells
does not diminish the generation of inflammatory cytokines (18, 7, 25). In our model of
histoplasmosis, the fungal burden and not the absence of the transcription factor was responsible
for the enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production observed in the Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.
The exception was IL-10; this cytokine was elevated in the lungs of the conditional knockouts
independent of the fungal load. This result establishes that the loss of HIF-1α results in an early
increase in IL-10, and this heightened response undermined the integrity of the innate immune
response. A previous study by our group documented that the loss of IL-10 enhanced clearance
of the fungus (33). However, the influence of this loss was not observed until adaptive immunity
was operative. The current information clearly documents that early, exaggerated IL-10 can alter
the function of M.
While several studies demonstrate that HIF-1α induces IL-10 transcription, here we
established that deficiency of this transcription factor alone or in conjunction with HIF-2α
deficiency actually elevates IL-10 transcript and protein production during H. capsulatum
infection (53, 74). Although counterintuitive, there are several lines of evidence that support the
notion that HIFs may moderate IL-10. First, inhibition of Hif-1α transcriptional induction in
BMDMs enhances IL-10 transcript and secreted protein following infection with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75). Second, LPS-challenged mice deficient in myeloid HIF-2α
exhibit an elevation in circulating IL-10 (76). Taken together, these results indicate that the
influence of HIFs on IL-10 may be context dependent.
One of the principal issues raised by our findings is how IL-10 dampened innate
immunity. Ms must be activated by exogenous signals to exert anti-Histoplasma activity, and

81

IFN-γ is central to the activation of M (77, 60). One known effect of IL-10 is that it blunts IFNγ-induced activation of Ms thus thwarting the arming of these phagocytes to limit intracellular
infection (78, 58). We asked if the heightened IL-10 in Ms from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice altered
responsiveness to IFN-γ. Indeed, IFN-γ did not restrict fungal growth in these cells in vitro
unless IL-10 was neutralized. In vivo, anti-IL-10 restored immunity as evidenced by a reduction
in CFUs and an increase in survival. Although the bulk of IFN-γ is produced after day 5 largely
by CD4+ T cells in an IL-12-dependent manner, there is an early production of this cytokine by
unidentified sources (79). This initial generation appears to be important for early activation of
Ms to limit intracellular growth.
In several infectious models, HIF-1α has been found to exert protection via induction of
iNOS and subsequent generation of NO (22, 24). In fact IFN-γ-mediated macrophage activation
leads to H. capsulatum growth inhibition through stimulation of nitric oxide generation (59, 60).
However, we found that infection of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice is associated with comparable iNOS
transcript during early infection followed by an elevation during late infection. While these
results were not anticipated, they are in agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated
that IL-10 enhances macrophage NO generation in the presence of an activation signal (80, 81).
CREB was responsible for elevated IL-10 in the absence of HIF-1α. In order to drive
gene transcription, HIF-1α directly interacts with the CBP/p300 complex which can then bind to
target gene promoters (62). In addition to HIF-1α, CBP/p300 can interact with a wide variety of
transcription factors; competition for a limiting quantity of CBP/p300 regulates transcriptional
induction of HIF-1α targets (82, 83). We hypothesized that the lack of HIF-1α allowed other
transcription factors to bind to CBP thus enhancing transcriptional induction of IL-10. One such
factor is CREB, which is required for β-glucan-stimulated IL-10 in murine BMDMs (84). Our

82

data indicate that CREB drives elevated IL-10 transcription in M in response to H. capsulatum;
HIF-1α deficiency augmented CREB-mediated IL-10 production. While there are numerous
binding sites on CBP, the contribution of other transcription factors to IL-10 production in the
absence of HIF-1α is unlikely given that IL-10 protein is nearly lost with CREB inhibition or
silencing. Our data suggests a novel mechanism of IL-10 regulation dependent on transcription
factor competition for binding to CBP. In contrast to other models, HIF-1α is required to temper
anti-inflammatory IL-10 production during the innate immune response to H. capsulatum
infection. This finding is in accord with recent evidence that inhibition of HIF-1α elevates IL-10
secretion by LPS-treated BMDMs (75).
Although IL-10 transcriptional induction and protein secretion occurs at 24 h in our in
vitro studies, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs only exhibit an increase relative to controls at 48 h.
While the mechanism of this delay is unclear, several modes of IL-10 regulation may be
responsible. The two most intriguing possibilities include control of IL-10 expression by
microRNAs and HIF-1α-dependent regulation of mRNA stability. Both of these could account
for the increase seen at both the transcriptional and resultant protein level. A variety of micro
RNAs which are regulated by HIF-1α have been shown to inhibit IL-10 production; these
include miR-27a and Let-7 family members Let-7b, Let-7c, and Let-7f (85–89). While few
studies have focused on the role of HIF-1α in controlling mRNA stability, it binds to VEGF
mRNA and regulates transcript decay (90, 91). One or both of these mechanisms may drive the
differential expression of IL-10 in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus control BMDMs.
Given the role of HIF-1α-dependent transcriptional regulation in vitro, the absence of an
alteration of IL-10 MFI between cells from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl and control mice was unexpected.
Our inability to capture a change in IL-10 MFI in the presence of a dramatic increase in IL-10

83

may be the result of in vivo dynamics. The delayed transcript changes that are seen in vitro are
observed in the absence of immigrating inflammatory cells. Moreover, infection in vitro is
synchronized such that all cells are exposed simultaneously to the pathogen. The coordinated
response does not occur in vivo since inflammatory cell recruitment is continuous and infection
of these cells is asynchronous. This may obscure any changes in IL-10 within cells in the lung.
In summary, we identified HIF-1α as a vital transcription factor in the M response to H.
capsulatum. HIF-1α was transcriptionally upregulated and protein stabilized in H. capsulatuminfected M exposed to normoxia. HIF-1α fortified the innate response to this fungus by
tempering the production of IL-10 in M. One clinical ramification of our work is in the arena of
the potential use of HIF inhibitors to treat malignancies (92). Based on our findings, this
intervention may pose a risk for those exposed to H. capsulatum or perhaps other intracellular
pathogens in which IL-10 is a prominent feature of their immune regulation. Thus, a cautious
approach may be warranted in the deployment of HIF-1α inhibitors.

CHAPTER 3
Dectin-1 mediated TNF-α production in response to H. capsulatum is essential for HIF-1α
induction

112

Introduction
Infection with a variety of pathogens has been associated with increased HIF-1α protein
and/or expression of downstream targets. LPS can induce HIF-1α through increased transcription
rather than protein stabilization in the setting of normoxia (1–4). While the mechanism of HIF1α protein stabilization and/or transcriptional induction is unknown, it accumulates in the setting
of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Hepatitis B and C, Human
Papilloma Virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis, and the fungal pathogens
Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans (5–13). These studies suggest that, while HIF-1α
plays an undeniable role in the cellular response to hypoxia, it may have been co-opted as a
transcription factor in the response to pathogens as well.
Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus with worldwide distribution. Ms are the
primary phagocytic cell that engulfs H. capsulatum. Our lab has recently shown that M HIF-1α
is essential for fungal growth restriction and mouse survival, but the mechanisms that lead to
induction of HIF-1α have not been elucidated (14).
Macrophages recognize H. capsulatum via CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and dectin-1. While CR3
is required for phagocytosis, CR3 and dectin-1 are both required for production of TNF-α, which
occurs via the Syk/JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. TNF-α is critical for host defenses to H.
capsulatum in primary infection. TNF-α exerts multiple effects including activation of
phagocytic cells, induction of apoptosis, and control of the CD4 + phenotype. TNF-α
neutralization impairs survival of mice (15). In addition, TNF-α can drive HIF-1α transcriptional
induction (16).
The critical role of this transcription factor in response to infection coupled with the
incomplete understanding of the factors that drive HIF-1α protein accumulation in the setting of

113

pathogen exposure in normoxia led us to study the mechanism of HIF-1α accrual in response to
H. capsulatum. We found that delayed transcriptional induction of HIF-1α is associated with
release of a soluble mediator from infected cells. TNF-α signaling was necessary for H.
capsulatum-dependent HIF-1α transcriptional induction. Therefore, we suggest that dectin-1
dependent TNF-α production in response to H. capsulatum is required for transcriptional
induction of HIF-1α.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Male C57BL/6 and Tnfr1tm1Mak breeding pairs were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME). We thank Dr. Gurjit Khurana Hershey, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center, for the Clec7a knockout mice. Animals were housed in isolator cages and maintained by
the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, accredited by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati.

Preparation of H. capsulatum and infection of mice
H. capsulatum strain G217B and yeast cells of the same strain that express GFP were grown for
72 h at 37oC as described (24, 25). To infect mice, 6–8 week-old animals were inoculated
intranasally with 2x106 yeasts or 2x107 yeasts (indicated as high dose) in ~30 µl of Hank’s
Balanced Salt Solution (HyClone, Logan, UT). For in vitro infection, cells were allowed to
adhere to plates for 3 h. Cells were infected with 1-5 yeast per M for the indicated times.

Generation of bone marrow-derived Ms (BMDMs) and in vitro inhibition
Bone marrow was isolated from tibiae and femurs of 6–10-week-old mice by flushing with
HBSS. Cells were dispensed into tissue culture flasks at a density of 1x10 6 cells/ml of RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, 5 µM 2mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml of mouse GM-CSF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Flasks were
115

incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2. Ms were harvested at day 7. Non-adherent cells were removed,
ice-cold PBS was added, and cells were scraped from the flask. Cells were collected, washed
with PBS, and dispensed into culture dishes. For inhibition studies, piceatannol (Tocris, Bristol,
UK) was added to Ms 90 minutes before infection. For CBP interaction inhibition studies,
chetomin (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) was added to Ms 30 minutes prior to infection and KG501
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added 90 minutes before infection.

RNA Isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA from whole lungs of mice was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
from in vitro M cultures using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Oligo(dT)-primed
cDNA was prepared by using the reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Madison, WI).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan master
mixture and primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were analyzed with ABI
Prism 7500. The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase housekeeping gene was used as an
internal control. The conditions for amplification were 50 oC for 2 min and 95oC for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95oC for 15 sec and 60oC for 1 min.

Isolation of lung leukocytes
Lungs were homogenized with the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in
5ml of HBSS with 2 mg/ml of collagenase D (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 40U of DNase I
(Roche) for 30 min at 37oC. The homogenate was percolated through a 40 mm nylon mesh
(Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and washed three times with HBSS.
Leukocytes were isolated by separation on Lympholyte M (Cedarlane, Burlington, ON).

116

Flow cytometry, cell sorting, and gating strategy
Cells from mouse lungs were incubated with CD16/32 to limit nonspecific binding. Leukocytes
were then stained with the indicated antibodies at 4oC for 15-30 min in phosphate-buffered saline
containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were stained with
combinations of the following antibodies: FITC-conjugated Ly6G; FITC-conjugated Ly6C;
FITC-conjugated CD11c; PerCP-conjugated CD11b; APC-conjugated CD3; PE-conjugated
CD4; FITC-conjugated CD8; and APC-conjugated F4/80 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For
intracellular IL-10 staining, cells were incubated with Cytofix/ Cytoperm (BD Biosciences),
washed in Permeabilization Buffer (BD Biosciences), and stained for 45 min with PE-conjugated
IL-10 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were washed and resuspended in 1%
paraformaldehyde. Isotype controls were used. Data were acquired using BD Accuri C6
cytometer and analyzed using the FCS Express 4.0 Software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles,
CA). For cell sorting experiments, infected M were isolated from the lungs of control mice at
day 7 post-infection using 5 laser FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) following cell surface staining.
Cells were identified using side (SSC-A) and forward scatter (FSC-A), followed by doublet
exclusion using forward scatter height (FSC-H) against FSC-A. M were subsequently
phenotypically characterized by F4/80+, CD11c-, CD11b+. As gated here, the M population
does not include interstitial M or alveolar M.

Western blot
Following 24 h of infection, non-adherent cells were washed off with ice cold PBS. Cells were
scraped off in ice cold PBS and spun down. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were

117

separated by electrophoresis in SDS/PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The
membranes were used for immunodetection of HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and β
actin (Santa Cruz).

Statistics
Statistical p values were calculated with one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons and
adjusted with Bonferroni’s or Holm Sidak correction and nonpaired Student’s t test where two
groups were compared; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant

Results and discussion
Transcriptional induction of M HIF-1α in response to H. capsulatum is delayed both in
vivo and in vitro.
Since HIF-1α protein can be elevated by stabilization or transcriptional induction after a
stimulus, we sought to determine if there was any alteration in transcript following infection with
H. capsulatum. To assess transcriptional induction of HIF-1α as well as several downstream
targets including vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf-a) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1
(Pgk-1) in vivo, we infected animals with H. capsulatum expressing GFP and sorted infected
pulmonary Ms (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD11c- GFP+ or GFP-) at 1, 3, and 7 days post-infection.
Infected cells exhibited transcriptional upregulation of Hif-1α, Vegf-a, and Pgk-1 (Fig. 1A).
We have previously shown that HIF-1α is upregulated in BMDMs after 24 h of
infection with H. capsulatum. To determine if transcriptional induction is delayed in vitro we
infected BMDMs and assessed HIF-1α and its downstream target genes at 4, 8, 16, and 24 h
post-infection (Fig. 1B). We found that Hif-1α transcript does not increase until 16 h and
continues to increase by 24 h post-infection. Upregulation of both Vegf-a and Pgk-1 was found at
24 h. The delay in transcriptional induction suggested that a soluble mediator might drive this
response in M.

A soluble mediator released from infected M is capable of inducing HIF-1α in uninfected
Ms.
Soluble factors such as TNF-α can drive HIF-1α accumulation and activation (16, 26,
27). TNF-α is a critical cytokine in the immune response to H. capsulatum that is released by
119

Ms (28, 29). To assess the potential contribution of a soluble mediator, we placed BMDMs
into the lower wells of a transwell plate. We then placed BMDMs alone, H. capsulatum alone,
or infected cells in the upper well (Fig. 2A). Hif-1α and Vegf-a transcript were elevated in
uninfected cells exposed to infected but not uninfected cells (Fig. 2B).
To determine if uninfected cells exhibit transcriptional induction of HIF-1α or its
downstream targets in vivo, we infected animals with H. capsulatum expressing GFP and sorted
infected and uninfected pulmonary Ms (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD11c- GFP+ or F4/80+ CD11b+
CD11c- GFP-) at 1, 3, and 7 days post-infection. Hif-1α and Vegf-a were both upregulated at day
7 post-infection in uninfected pulmonary Ms (Fig. 2C).

TNF-α signaling is required for M induction of HIF-1α and its downstream targets.
Since TNF-α has been implicated in HIF-1α induction and activation in other cell types,
we sought to determine if this cytokine could enhance HIF-1α in BMDMs. We found that TNFα caused an elevation in Hif-1α and Vegf-a transcript at 2 and 4 hours post-infection, but this
response was not maintained at later time points (Fig. 3A). However, lack of TNF-α signaling
through TNFR1 at 24 h post-infection with H. capsulatum led to reduced transcription of Hif-1α,
Vegf-a, and Pgk-1 (Fig. 3B).
In this study, we have demonstrated that a soluble mediator can drive transcriptional
induction of HIF-1α in Ms in response to H. capsulatum infection. We identified TNF-α as a
potential candidate and established the need for this cytokine in transcriptional induction of HIF1α. However, other soluble mediators such as IL-1β may also promote elevated HIF-1α protein
(30). The influence of other mediators known to be elevated during H. capsulatum infection
should be examined.
120

Dectin-1 signaling is required for HIF-1α transcription and protein accumulation.
Maximal M TNF-α production in response to H. capsulatum requires dectin-1 signaling
(29, 31). To determine the necessity of this receptor in HIF-1α induction, we infected control and
dectin-1 deficient BMDMs with H. capsulatum. HIF-1α and its downstream target genes were
not induced in the absence of dectin-1 (Fig. 4A). The best characterized dectin-1 signaling
pathway is through activation of Syk upstream of TNF-α (32). We, therefore, utilized a Syk
inhibitor (piceatannol) to inhibit this signaling pathway. Hif-1α transcript was nearly absent
while Vegf-a was reduced (Fig. 4B).
While we have demonstrated that dectin-1 signaling is required for HIF-1α induction, we
have not examined the role of this signaling pathway in TNF-α production. To test this, we will
analyze TNF-α in the supernatant from control and dectin-1 deficient BMDMs with H.
capsulatum. We anticipate that the reduction in HIF-1α and its downstream targets is due to a
decrement in TNF-α production by infected Ms that lack dectin-1 signaling.
We revealed a requirement for dectin-1 signaling in HIF-1α transcriptional induction
during H. capsulatum infection. However, the Syk inhibitor that we utilized is not specific. In
order to clarify the contribution of the canonical and non-canonical dectin-1 signaling pathways
to HIF-1α induction, we will perform these experiments with a Raf-1 inhibitor as well as
additional Syk inhibitor. To specifically address the impact of these pathways, we will perform
siRNA silencing prior to infection; we anticipate that HIF-1α transcript will be reduced in the
absence of canonical signaling, but not in the absence of non-canonical signaling.
Taken together these results suggest a model by which H. capsulatum drives TNF-α
production in Ms. TNF-α then signals through M in an autocrine or paracrine manner to drive
121

transcriptional induction of HIF-1α. These data will be developed further in the discussion
section of the thesis.

Introduction
Infection with a variety of pathogens has been associated with increased hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein and/or expression of downstream targets. HIF-1α accumulates
in the setting of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Hepatitis B
and C, Human Papilloma Virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis, and the fungal
pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans (1–9). These studies suggest that HIF-1α
it may have been co-opted as a transcription factor in the response to pathogens in addition to its
role in hypoxia. While HIF-1α is beneficial for the host response to many of these pathogens, it
has been co-opted by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Leishmania amazonensis
(1, 6, 10).
Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus with worldwide distribution.
Macrophages (Ms) are the primary phagocytic cell that engulfs H. capsulatum. Prior to cellular
activation, Ms are permissive for intracellular fungal growth. After cellular activation with IFNγ or GM-CSF, Ms inhibit intracellular growth of H. capsulatum (11). Our lab has recently
shown that M HIF-1α is essential for fungal growth restriction and mouse survival (12).
Following infection, M HIF-1α was essential for restricting IL-10 production. Elevated IL-10 in
the absence of HIF-1α was able to prevent IFN-γ-mediated M activation.
While HIF-1α is necessary for a successful response to a wide variety of pathogens
including H. capsulatum, the downstream factors that mediate this response have only been
partially elucidated. Here we sought to determine the HIF-1α-dependent factors that influence
the immune response to this fungal pathogen by performing RNA-seq on BMDMs from both
uninfected and infected Hif1αfl/fl and Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl mice. In addition to the target genes that
regulate glycolysis and mediate a response to hypoxia, we have identified factors that regulate
133

the immune response and proteasome degradation. We identified miR-27 as a potential mediator
of the diminished IL-10 found in the absence of HIF-1α.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and
translation to control protein expression (13). miRNAs can be upregulated in response to
pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS or cytokines including TNF-α and
IL-1β (14, 15). microRNAs have been shown to target IL-10 mRNA, which results in instability
and degradation (16). microRNAs that directly regulate IL-10 post-transcriptionally include
miR-106a, miR-4661, miR-98, miR-27, let7, and miR-1423p/5p (16). We identified a decrease in
several let7 family members as well as miR-27 in infected Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs relative
to controls via RNA-seq. We confirmed the decrease in miR-27 with qRT-PCR. Future work will
explore the impact of these factors on the host response to H. capsulatum.

Materials and Methods
Mice
We thank Dr. Timothy Eubank, Ohio State University, for the Hif1αfl/fl and Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl
mice. Animals were housed in isolator cages and maintained by the Department of Laboratory
Animal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with the Animal Welfare Act guidelines of the National Institutes of Health, and all protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Cincinnati. 6-10 week old Hif1αfl/fl and Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl mice were sacrificed and bone marrow
was isolated from tibiae and femurs by flushing with HBSS. Cells were dispensed into tissue
culture flasks at a density of 1x106 cells/ml of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, 5 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml of mouse GM-CSF
(Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Flasks were incubated at 37 oC in 5% CO2. Ms were harvested at
day 6. Non-adherent cells were removed, ice-cold PBS was added, and cells were scraped from
the flask. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, and dispensed into culture dishes.

Preparation of H. capsulatum and infection of Ms
H. capsulatum strain G217B and yeast cells of the same strain that express GFP were grown for
72 h at 37oC as described (11, 17). Cells were allowed to adhere to plates for 3 h. Cells were
infected with 5 yeast per M. After 24 hour infection, RNA was collected using Qiagen RnEasy
and submitted to UC Genomics, Epigenomics, and Sequencing Core.

RNA-seq
135

RNA-seq was performed by Genomics, Epigenomics and Sequencing Core (GESC) at the
University of Cincinnati. RNA-seq methods were provided by the GESC.

Target RNA enrichment - Isolation of polyA RNA
NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was
used for polyA RNA purification with a total of 50 ng to 1 µg good quality total RNA as input.
The Core used Apollo 324 system (WaferGen, Fremont, CA) and ran a PrepX PolyA script for
automated polyA RNA isolation.

Automated RNA-seq library preparation
PrepX mRNA Library kit (WaferGen) combined Apollo 324 NGS automated library prep system
was used for library preparation, which is an RNA ligation-based method to maintain strand
specificity. In short, the isolated polyA RNA or rRNA/globin depleted RNA was RNase III
fragmented, adaptor-ligated to maintain strand specificity and Superscript III reverse
transcriptase (Lifetech, Grand Island, NY) converted into cDNA, followed by automated
purification using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis IN). The
targeted cDNA fragment is around 200 bp.

Next, using the universal and index-specific primer with limited PCR cycle number (~13),
sample-specific index was added to each adaptor-ligated cDNA sample and the amplified library
was cleaned up by AMPure XP beads in Apollo 324 system with the final elution volume of 16
µl. To check the quality and yield of the purified library, one µl library was analyzed by
Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using DNA high sensitivity chip. To accurately quantify

136

the library concentration for the clustering, the library was 1:10 4 diluted in dilution buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 0.05% Tween 20), and qPCR measured by Kapa Library
Quantification kit (Kapabiosystem, Woburn, MA) using ABI's 9700HT real-time PCR system
(Thermo Fisher).

Cluster Generation and HiSeq Sequencing
To study differential gene expression, individually indexed and compatible libraries were
proportionally pooled (20-50 million reads per sample in general) for clustering in cBot system
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries at the final concentration of 15 pM were clustered onto a
single read (SR) flow cell using Illumina TruSeq SR Cluster kit v3, and sequenced to 50 bp using
TruSeq SBS kit on Illumina HiSeq system.

Differential gene expression
To analyze differential gene expression, sequence reads were aligned to the genome by using
standard Illumina sequence analysis pipeline, which was analyzed by The Laboratory for
Statistical Genomics and Systems Biology in the University of Cincinnati. The report consists of:
1) RNA-seq data quality control (QC) and sample clustering analyzing results; 2) All gene
expression level in RNA samples; 3) Significantly differentially expressed genes between two
treatment groups (if applicable); and 4) Gene Ontology or KEGG pathway analysis.

Gene Set Analysis and Clustering Visualization
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the javaGSEA Desktop application
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)(18, 19). The following gene sets were

137

downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database version 5.1
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/): hallmark gene sets (h.al.v5.1) and canonical
pathways (c2.cp.v5.1), resulting in 1370 gene sets total. GSEA was performed on complete
RNA-Seq expression data from all Hif1αfl/fl and Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl infected M samples. GSEA
phenotype analysis was performed using weighted enrichment statistic and the signal-to-noise
metric for ranking genes. Number of permutations was equal to 1000, gene set minimum size
was equal to 5, and all other settings were left at default. Gene set enrichment was then
visualized using Cytoscape version 3.2.1 (http://www.cytoscape.org/) and the Enrichment Map
plugin version 2.1.0 (http://www.baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap) (20, 21). In order to
capture subtle differences between groups, cutoff values in Enrichment Map were relaxed to PValue = 0.1, Q-value = 0.25 and Overlap Coefficient = 0.25. Gene set clusters were examined
for major pathways and labeled manually.

Pathway analysis
Further analysis of significantly altered gene pathways was performed using the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (22, 23). The raw data of the
experiment will be submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)
with accession number xxxxx (to be submitted).

138

Results and discussion
Due to the striking nature of the immune defect found in Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl mice, we
decided to perform RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on infected and uninfected Ms from
Hif1αfl/fl and Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl mice in order to identify target genes for further investigation.
Here we found that a host of genes were differentially regulated in infected Lyz2cre/cre
Hif1αfl/fl Ms relative to controls (Fig. 1). However, immune related pathways were largely
unaltered at the RNA level between these groups (Fig. 2-5). Indeed, only IRF7 was found to be
differentially expressed in infected Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl Ms compared to uninfected Lyz2cre/cre
Hif1αfl/fl Ms, but not in Hif1αfl/fl Ms compared to uninfected Hif1αfl/fl Ms (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).
While this technique did not provide the insight into dysregulation of IL-10 production in
Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl Ms that we anticipated, the alterations seen here will help elucidate future
targets to study. In addition to our own RT-PCR confirmation that HIF-1α was knocked out in
these M, we found that glycolysis and pathways associated with the response to hypoxia were
diminished in Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl compared to Hif1αfl/fl Ms (Fig. 6). Since this analysis largely
identified glycolytic and hypoxia pathway targets we elevated the false discovery rate (FDR) in
order to detect additional targets that may explain the altered immune response to H. capsulatum
in Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl mice compared to Hif1αfl/fl mice. This enabled us to detect a wide variety of
genes that were elevated in the Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl compared to Hif1αfl/fl Ms. Most of the
additional genes detected by elevating the FDR are involved in proteasomal degradation.
While we did not intend to target miRNA with our isolation procedure, we were able to
detect miRNA in our reads. We found that Let7i, Let7bgh, Let7ad, and miR-27 were decreased
in the Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl compared to Hif1αfl/fl Ms. These miRNAs have been shown to regulate
IL-10 expression (24, 25). As an initial pass, we examined the expression of miR-27 in Lyz2cre/cre
139

Hif1αfl/fl and Hif1αfl/fl Ms before, prior to, and after H. capsulatum infection. In these
preliminary experiments, we found that miR-27 was unaltered in Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl Ms
compared to Hif1αfl/fl Ms prior to infection, but was reduced in infected Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl
compared to Hif1αfl/fl Ms following infection. These results suggest that decreased expression of
miR27a following infection of Lyz2cre/cre Hif1αfl/fl Ms are correlated with increased IL-10.
Future experiments will tests the hypothesis that miR-27 regulates IL-10 expression in a HIF-1αdependent manner following infection with H. capsulatum. These results will be discussed
further in the discussion of this thesis.

Discussion
Successful resolution of H. capsulatum infection requires coordination between innate
and adaptive immunity. While the factors governing the adaptive response have been extensively
studied, molecular mechanisms that occur in innate immune cells prior to and after phagocytosis
and/or cellular activation require further elucidation.
Inflammatory monocytes and macrophages (Ms) constitute one of the largest cell
populations that phagocytose H. capsulatum (1). These cells represent both a repository for the
organism as well as a site for growth inhibition following activation (2). Once these cells are
infected they can be found at the center of the developing granuloma (1). The center of the H.
capsulatum-induced granuloma is hypoxic (3). Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is one of
the fundamental transcription factors in the response to low oxygen tension.
HIF-1α has been implicated in the innate immune response to a wide variety of pathogens
as outlined in Chapter 1. The work presented in this thesis builds upon the expanding knowledge
of the function of this transcription factor. In the following sections the novel findings in this
thesis will be summarized, followed by a discussion of potential future directions for this work.

HIF-1α is induced in response to H. capsulatum
HIF-1α protein is elevated in Ms following exposure to a wide variety of pathogens as
reviewed in Chapter 1. This increase is associated with elevated transcription and/or enhanced
protein stabilization. We found that HIF-1α protein was elevated in both the cytoplasm and the
nucleus following M infection with H. capsulatum. We were able to detect transcriptional
induction in Ms both in vitro as well as ex vivo isolated from infected mouse lungs. Although
this may account for some of the HIF-1α elevation, the delay in transcriptional induction in ex
156

vivo cells suggests that stabilization may occur prior to this. Early stabilization may be necessary
for production of cytokines and chemokines in the early immune response to H. capsulatum.

M HIF-1α is protective
We anticipated a role for myeloid HIF-1α in shaping the adaptive immune response to
mouse histoplasmosis since hypoxia is detected within liver granulomas induced by i.p. injection
of yeast cells (3). However, protective immunity was subverted in the Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice
prior to the onset of adaptive immunity. These data indicated that a maladaptive innate response
led to the phenotype of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice.
To hone in on the innate immune cell population responsible for the defective immune
response in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice, we evaluated the contribution of various myeloid lineage
cells. Ms, alveolar Ms, neutrophils (PMNs), and resident DCs are important for phagocytosis
of yeast cells following infection (4–6). These cells release cytokines and chemokines that
facilitate mobilization of the inflammatory response to combat invasion by H. capsulatum. Since
Itgaxcre Hif1αfl/fl mice did not manifest impaired survival we conclude that HIF-1α within DCs
and alveolar Ms is dispensable following H. capsulatum infection. The fact that elimination of
PMNs from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice did not alter fungal burden signifies that HIF-1α deficiency in
this population was not a contributor to the failed protective immune response. These data
strongly suggest that HIF-1α within Ms is critical for H. capsulatum clearance. In the absence
of this transcription factor mice not only exhibit dramatically elevated fungal burden, but they
succumb to infection within 2 weeks.
Although the cause of death of Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice is currently unknown, our data
suggest that several factors may be responsible. We suspect that the elevated fungal burden
157

impairs the appetite and the ability to get water. Although we have not presented the data, this is
consistent with our finding that the Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice become smaller and less mobile over
the course of H. capsulatum infection. We have not checked their temperature or blood pressure
so we cannot rule out the contribution of these factors. There is no evidence that the mice die
from hyperinflammation or massive tissue destruction since the lung histology of Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl mice is not significantly different from controls as presented in Chapter 2.

HIF-1α is required for tempering IL-10 production
The pivotal contribution of HIF-1α in response to H. capsulatum was not to drive
inflammatory cytokine production, but rather to temper IL-10. This finding is quite unexpected
since HIF-1α binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) that exist in the promoters for several
cytokines and chemokines important in the myeloid response to H. capsulatum including TNF-α,
CCL2, and IL-10 (7–9). The loss of HIF-1α did not reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine
production or cell recruitment to the lungs following infection. In fact, there was an increase in
several of these prototypically protective cytokines in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl lungs relative to control.
These data contrast with infectious models in which decreased myeloid pro-inflammatory
cytokine production is noted in the absence of HIF-1α; however, our data are congruent with a
study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice where the lack of HIF-1α in myeloid cells
does not diminish the generation of inflammatory cytokines (10–12). In our model of
histoplasmosis, the fungal burden, and not the absence of the transcription factor, was
responsible for the enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production observed in the Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl mice. The exception was IL-10; this cytokine was elevated in the lungs of the
conditional knockouts independent of the fungal load. This result establishes that the loss of HIF158

1α results in an early increase in IL-10, and this heightened response undermined the integrity of
the innate immune response. A previous study by our group documented that the loss of IL-10
enhanced clearance of the fungus (13). However, the influence of this loss was not observed until
adaptive immunity was operative. The current information clearly documents that early,
exaggerated IL-10 can alter the function of M.
While several studies demonstrate that HIF-1α induces IL-10 transcription, here we
established that deficiency of this transcription factor alone or in conjunction with HIF-2α
deficiency actually elevates IL-10 transcript and protein production during H. capsulatum
infection (14, 15). Although counterintuitive, some data are emerging to support the notion that
HIFs may moderate IL-10. First, inhibition of Hif-1α transcriptional induction in BMDMs
enhances IL-10 transcript and secreted protein following infection with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (16). Second, LPS-challenged mice deficient in myeloid HIF-2α exhibit an elevation
in circulating IL-10 (17). Taken together, these results indicate that the influence of HIFs on IL10 may be context dependent.

cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent IL-10 induction
Immune cell expression of IL-10 is regulated at the level of transcription by a wide
variety of transcription factors as well as post-transcriptionally by a variety of microRNAs
(miRNAs) (18). We identified transcriptional upregulation of IL-10 in BMDMs from Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl mice relative to controls. We identified CREB as the primary transcription factor
responsible for elevated IL-10. While this may explain the IL-10 elevation we see, miRNAs may
also play a role in this upregulation. In chapter 4 we identified let7 and miR-27 as potential

159

candidates for IL-10 regulation following infection with H. capsulatum. We will outline
experiments to test the contribution of these miRNAs in future directions.

IL-10 inhibits M immunity
One of the principal issues raised by our findings is how IL-10 dampened innate
immunity. Ms must be activated by exogenous signals to exert anti-Histoplasma activity, and
IFN-γ is central to the activation of M (19, 20). One known effect of IL-10 is that it blunts IFNγ-induced activation of Ms thus thwarting the arming of these phagocytes to limit intracellular
infection (21, 22). We asked if the heightened IL-10 in Ms from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl mice altered
responsiveness to IFN-γ. Indeed, IFN-γ did not restrict fungal growth in these cells in vitro
unless IL-10 was neutralized. In vivo, anti-IL-10 restored immunity as evidenced by a reduction
in CFUs and an increase in survival. Although the bulk of IFN-γ produced after day 5 is largely
released by CD4+ T cells in an IL-12-dependent manner, there is an early production of this
cytokine by unidentified sources (23–25). This initial generation appears to be important for
early activation of Ms to limit intracellular growth.

PMNs are not required for effective clearance of H. capsulatum
Elimination of PMNs from control mice did not alter fungal burden. This contradicts
prior studies whose results strongly suggest that PMNs are essential for H. capsulatum clearance
(26, 27). However, those studies employed the antibody RB6 which is now known to recognize
Ly-6G and Ly-6C. The latter is borne by inflammatory monocytes (28). Therefore it is quite
likely that in those experiments both PMNs and inflammatory monocytes were depleted. The

160

mAb that we employed, 1A8, is considered to be more selective for Ly-6G, which should
selectively deplete PMNs (28).

Clinical relevance
HIF-1α fortified the innate response to H. capsulatum by tempering the production of IL10 in Ms. One clinical ramification of our work is in the arena of the potential use of HIF
inhibitors to treat cancer (29). Based on our findings, this intervention may pose a risk for those
exposed to H. capsulatum or perhaps other intracellular pathogens in which IL-10 is a prominent
feature of their immune regulation. Thus, a cautious approach may be warranted in the
deployment of HIF-1α inhibitors.
While we found a dramatic increase in mouse mortality in the absence of myeloid HIF1α, our work did not examine the impact of elevated HIF-1α. Given the increased incidence of
histoplasmosis in individuals with an adaptive immune system defect, HIF-1α may represent a
potential target for innate immune activation. Further studies to address the impact of HIF-1α
elevation on the immune response to H. capsulatum would be necessary to assess this possibility.
Our work also demonstrates the deleterious role of IL-10 during H. capsulatum infection.
There is currently no data on IL-10 in patients with disseminated H. capsulatum, but it represents
a truly intriguing area of potential impact. IL-10 production is known to be highly variable
between individuals (30). Human studies have demonstrated that between 50-70% of observed
variability in IL-10 production is the result of genetic factors (30, 31). Individuals that are
genetically pre-disposed to produce more IL-10 may be more at risk of infection or
dissemination. IL-10 neutralization represents one potential avenue to reduce this risk. Anti-IL-

161

10 antibodies have been successfully administered in a small cohort of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) patients and the treatment was safe and well tolerated (32). Together these
data suggest that IL-10 neutralization in patients with H. capsulatum may be beneficial.

Future Directions
Two major questions that are unanswered by our work are: 1. what is the mechanism of
increased HIF-1α in the M response to H. capsulatum? 2. Are there other mechanisms of IL-10
regulation in HIF-1α deficient Ms?
As illustrated in Fig. 5.1, stabilization and transcription may both be implicated in the
process of elevated HIF-1α. The contribution of these two processes may be critical in the timing
of a HIF-1α-dependent response. Due to the constant synthesis and degradation of HIF-1α,
increased stability may elevate protein levels in short order while transcription dependent change
may be comparatively delayed. While transcription dependent changes may seem unnecessary
when stabilization can act so rapidly, multiple groups have demonstrated that transcription
dependent elevation of HIF-1α rather than stabilization is critical in immune cells in some
settings (33, 34).

162

Figure 5.1 HIF-1α regulation via transcription and stabilization
HIF-1α is regulated via transcription and protein stabilization. Receptor mediated signals are responsible for
transcriptional activation and subsequent protein synthesis. PHD-dependent hydroxylation is responsible for
ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. In the absence of essential cofactors or in the presence of inhibitors,
PHD activity decreases and this leads to an elevation of HIF-1α protein. HIF-1α can then bind to ARNT, translocate
to the nucleus and drive transcription of downstream targets.

We hypothesize that H. capsulatum-mediated HIF-1α accumulation requires early
stabilization that is not dependent on transcription. To directly assess the impact of protein
synthesis and protein stabilization, we will perform Western blot analysis in H. capsulatum
infected BMDMs treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. If stabilization is

163

the primary means of elevating HIF-1α, cycloheximide would be expected to have little or no
impact on the amount of HIF-1α protein detected. One technical difficulty with this and future
experiments is the ability to detect mouse HIF-1α via Western blot. To avoid this problem we
may utilize human derived monocytes or Ms in this and future Western blot experiments. Our
collaborators have had success in detecting HIF-1α in these cells following infection with H.
capsulatum.
As mentioned previously, PHD-dependent hydroxylation of the oxygen dependent
degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1α leads to recognition by VHL and subsequent degradation
of HIF-1α (35). Since diminished PHD2 expression may be responsible for decreased HIF-1α
hydroxylation, we will examine transcriptional regulation of this protein via qRT-PCR as well as
protein level via Western blot. To assess the contribution of decreased hydroxylation by PHD2,
we will then perform Western blot analysis for HIF-1α hydroxylated at proline 564 in the
presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Use of this inhibitor will allow us to analyze the
hydroxylated form of HIF-1α that would normally be degraded in this and all future experiments
that assess the hydroxylation of HIF-1α. If protein stabilization is responsible for elevated HIF1α, we would expect to find a decrease in hydroxylated HIF-1α following infection with H.
capsulatum.
Factors that determine the stability of HIF-1α include PHD cofactors oxygen and Fe2+
iron as well as ROS and NO (35–39). Deficiency of PHD cofactors leads to decreased
hydroxylation and, ultimately, increased HIF-1α (35). ROS promotes oxidation of PHD2 bound
iron from Fe2+ to Fe3+, which leads to decreased hydroxylase activity (39). NO promotes HIF-1α
accumulation via inhibition of PHD2 possibly via s-nitrosylation of this protein (38). However,
the contribution of NO to HIF-1α is complicated since other studies have demonstrated

164

decreased HIF-1α when exogenous NO donors are utilized (40). To assess the involvement of
these factors in the accumulation of HIF-1α protein, we will determine which factors promote
elevation of this transcription factor.
We hypothesize that NO is responsible for HIF-1α stabilization following H. capsulatum
infection. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is
transcriptionally induced in H. capsulatum-infected mouse M. NO was detected in supernatants
from these cells following activation with IFN-γ. In order to test the contribution of NO, we will
perform a Western blot time course to assess HIF-1α protein and hydroxylation at proline 564
following treatment with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME. We will expect to find diminished HIF-1α
protein and elevated HIF-1α hydroxylation if NO is required for protein stabilization. If we are
forced to use human M for Western blot experiments, one hurdle is the potential lack of NO
produced by in vitro derived human monocytes and M (41). If we find that NO is not produced
by H. capsulatum infected human M activated with IFN-γ, we may need to add NO to the
culture to assess its ability to stabilize HIF-1α. Since NO can be produced by both endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and iNOS, we will perform additional Western blot analysis for
HIF-1α in the presence of an eNOS or iNOS selective inhibitor (L-NNA and 1400 W,
respectively).
Another candidate that may drive HIF-1α stabilization is ROS, which is produced by M
within 20 minutes of H. capsulatum infection (42). To determine if ROS is required for elevated
HIF-1α protein, we will analyze BMDM protein lysates for HIF-1α across time following
infection and treatment with the ROS scavengers 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2carboxylic acid (Trolox) or LPX. ROS scavenger activity will be confirmed with the OxyBlot
assay for protein carbonyl groups, a marker of protein oxidation (43). If ROS is required for
165

elevated HIF-1α, we expect a decrease in HIF-1α protein from BMDMs treated with Trolox or
LPX.
In order to then identify the source of ROS, we will examine the two most common
sources of ROS, NADPH-oxidase and mitochondria. NADPH-oxidase activity will be measured
with a light detection assay as described in DeNicola et al; specificity will be determined with
the enzyme specific inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (44). In order to specifically address the
contribution of NADPH-oxidase, we will perform Western blot analysis of HIF-1α in infected
BMDMs derived from gp91phox knockout mice. MitoSOX will be utilized to examine the
contribution of mitochondrial-derived ROS. While these are the most likely sources, the
contribution of peroxisome and endoplastic reticulum derived ROS will be examined once other
sources are ruled out. If we determine that ROS is important in HIF-1α stabilization in mouse
Ms, it would be interesting to explore in human Ms where we have seen HIF-1α stabilization,
but past work has demonstrated an absence of M ROS production (45).
Iron sequestration represents an additional alternative that may drive HIF-1α
stabilization. Pathogens may decrease intracellular iron availability through the secretion of
siderophores that bind and sequester this metal. As mentioned in Chapter 1, bacterial
siderophores have been shown to induce HIF-1α expression through iron depletion (46). In this
study, the presence of siderophores was associated with a decrease in HIF-1α hydroxylation,
which is likely responsible for diminished von Hippel Lindau recognition and subsequently
reduced degradation (46). To examine the role of siderophores, we will perform Western blot
analysis of BMDMs infected with siderophore-deficient H. capsulatum in the presence of the
protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide. This inhibitor will allow us to determine the impact of
siderophore-dependent iron sequestration on HIF-1α stabilization. One potential problem is that
166

cyclohexamide may inhibit growth of the pathogen. Since we are most interested in HIF-1α
stabilization in the first few hours following infection when there is minimal fungal growth, this
is unlikely to impact our results. One other potential confounding factor is the presence of other
iron acquisition systems in H. capsulatum. While siderophore-silenced H. capsulatum does not
grow well on iron-deficient medium, the presence of ferric reductases may allow sufficient
depletion to inhibit PHD2 (47). In a separate series of experiments, we will add ferric ammonium
citrate (FAC), which is commonly used to load these cells with iron, to infected BMDMs and
then perform Western blot analysis. If iron sequestration during infection is responsible for
elevated HIF-1α, we would expect to find decreased HIF-1α protein in both of these
experiments.
Our alternative hypothesis is: de novo protein synthesis is required for M HIF-1α
protein accumulation following H. capsulatum infection. We will directly assess this by blocking
transcription with actinomycin D and performing Western blot analysis for HIF-1α following
infection. If transcription is required for HIF-1α protein elevation, we would expect a decrease in
protein with the use of this inhibitor. We will perform qRT-PCR to compare transcription of
HIF-1α in infected cells that were treated with actinomycin D to those that were not treated. We
would expect an increase in HIF-1α transcript if infection with H. capsulatum induces
transcription. We will then explore the role of signaling pathways that may drive HIF-1α
transcription.
Dectin-1 signaling has been implicated in HIF-1α elevation; β-glucan from H.
capsulatum drives phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) downstream of dectin-1 (48). Phosphorylation
of Akt was dependent on PI3K pathway signaling. Another group found that β-glucan from H.
capsulatum drives M transcription of TNF-α downstream of Syk signaling and dectin-1 (49).
167

We hypothesize that dectin-1 signaling in response to H. capsulatum β-glucan initiates Sykdependent TNF-α production, which then drives transcription downstream of PI3K. This model
is outlined in Fig. 5.2.

Figure 5.2 Proposed model of transcription-dependent HIF-1α regulation
Macrophages recognize H. capsulatum via CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and dectin-1. CR3 and dectin-1 are both required
for cytokine production, which occurs via the Syk/JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. Soluble mediators such as TNF-α
can subsequently signal through a PI3K pathway to drive HIF-1α transcriptional induction.

To address the requirement for dectin-1 in H. capsulatum-mediated HIF-1α induction, we
we will analyze Clec7a-/- and control BMDM protein lysates for HIF-1α across time following
infection. In Chapter 3 we observed that dectin-1 was required for transcriptional induction of

168

HIF-1α. While we demonstrated that dectin-1 signaling through Syk was essential, the Syk
inhibitor that we utilized has a variety of targets. We will, therefore, utilize the more specific Syk
inhibitor Bay 61-3606 to determine the requirement for canonical dectin-1 pathway signaling in
HIF-1α transcriptional induction in response to H. capsulatum.
We demonstrated with a transwell assay that a soluble mediator is required for
transcriptional induction of HIF-1α. Since HIF-1α protein is elevated and downstream targets are
transcriptionally induced at 24 h post-infection, any soluble cytokine that is responsible for this
response must be produced by infected M within 24 h following infection. We will perform
Magpix analysis of supernatants from infected BMDMs to determine the cytokines produced
during the first day of infection. Two cytokines that we anticipate finding that are known to
induce HIF-1α are TNF-α and IL-1β.
In Chapter 3, we demonstrated that TNF-α signaling was required for an elevation of
HIF-1α transcript. Although not published, Betty Wu-Hsieh’s group found that BMDMs
produce TNF-α as early as 3 h post infection, which is further elevated by 6 h. To determine if
TNF-α is required for protein accumulation, we will perform a Western blot for HIF-1α utilizing
infected Ms from TNF-α knockout mice. We would anticipate a reduction or loss of HIF-1α if
TNF-α is required. These mice would also allow us to question the role of TNF-α in HIF-1α in
vivo. We will infect control and TNF-α knockout mice and assess transcription of HIF-1α and its
downstream targets in Ms sorted from the lungs of infected animals. We would anticipate a
decrement in HIF-1α and its targets in the absence of TNF-α if this cytokine is required for HIF1α induction.
While our data points to a role for TNF-α, other soluble mediators such as IL-1β could be
required for HIF-1α induction. If we see no reduction or only a partial reduction in HIF-1α in the
169

absence of TNF-α, we will perform similar experiments to those outlined in the above paragraph
to examine the role of IL-1β.
Dectin-1 signaling in response to β-glucan from H. capsulatum was shown to drive PI3Kmediated HIF-1α accumulation (48). In order to determine the necessity of this pathway in HIF1α induction following infection, we will perform p-Akt and p-mTOR Western blots in
BMDMs utilizing inhibitors or knockouts from the relevant cytokines previously identified as
essential. The experiments outlined here will allow us to assess the contribution of both dectin-1
and PI3K signaling pathways in the transcriptional upregulation of HIF-1α following M
infection with H. capsulatum.

IL-10 regulation in HIF-1α deficient Ms
Although IL-10 transcriptional induction and protein secretion occurs at 24 h in our in
vitro studies, Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs only exhibit an increase relative to controls at 48 h.
While the mechanism of this delay is unclear, several modes of IL-10 regulation may be
responsible. The two most intriguing possibilities include control of IL-10 expression by
miRNAs and HIF-1α-dependent regulation of mRNA stability. Both of these could account for
the increase seen at both the transcriptional and resultant protein level. A variety of miRNAs
which are regulated by HIF-1α have been shown to inhibit IL-10 production; these include miR27 and Let-7 family members Let-7b, Let-7c, and Let-7f (50–54). While few studies have
focused on the role of HIF-1α in controlling mRNA stability, it binds to VEGF mRNA and
regulates transcript decay (55, 56). One or both of these mechanisms may drive the differential
expression of IL-10 in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus control BMDMs.

170

We hypothesize that decreased miRNA expression in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs allows
for continued expression of IL-10. Several miRNAs have been shown to regulate IL-10
expression including miR-27 and the Let7 family members. In Chapter 4, we observed that miR27 was decreased in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus control BMDMs. We plan to perform additional
qRT-PCR experiments to assess the amount of miR-27 as well as the Let7 family members
Let7i, Let7bgh, and Let7ad, which were all decreased in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus control
BMDMs in our RNA-seq data. If there is an increase in these miRNAs, we could test their
contribution to IL-10 production, by assessing IL-10 production from Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus
control BMDMs following overexpression of the relevant pre-miRNA or inhibition of the
miRNA with a locked nucleic acid (LNA). If these miRNAs are responsible for elevated IL-10 in
Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs, we would expect a decrease in IL-10 in the overexpression
experiment and an increase in the inhibition experiment. In addition, we could determine if these
miRNAs recognize IL-10 mRNA by performing a pull down experiment with subsequent qPCR
analysis for these miRNAs. We would expect a decrease in these miRNAs in the Lyz2cre
Hif1αfl/fl BMDMs compared to controls.
Alternatively, HIF-1α may directly decrease mRNA stability of IL-10. HIF-1α can bind
to VEGF to regulate transcript decay (55, 56). To address this possibility, we will perform a pull
down of HIF-1α and probe for IL-10 mRNA. We anticipate that IL-10 mRNA would be detected
in this assay if HIF-1α regulates transcript decay. However, the short half-life and poor antibody
detection may require additional stimulus such as LPS or hypoxia for enhanced HIF-1α. In
addition, we will measure IL-10 mRNA stability. We would anticipate that mRNA stability is
enhanced in Lyz2cre Hif1αfl/fl versus control BMDMs if this mechanism is involved in IL-10
elevation found in the absence of HIF-1α.
171

The experiments outlined in these future directions would help to clarify the mechanisms
by which HIF-1α is stabilized in the immune response to H. capsulatum as well as the
downstream effects that lead to elevated IL-10 in the absence of this essential transcription
factor. Ultimately these would expand our understanding of the importance of HIF-1α in the M
response to H. capsulatum. A potential model that incorporates the data in this thesis with these
future directions for M regulation of HIF-1α in response to infection can be found in Figure 5.3.

Proposed model

Fig. 5.3 Working model
Macrophage recognition of H. capsulatum via CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and dectin-1 may enhance HIF-1α either directly
via NO/ROS mediated stabilization or via Syk signaling driven transcriptional induction. Transcriptional induction
occurs via a soluble mediator, such as TNF-α or IL-1β. These cytokines can then act in an autocrine or paracrine
manner to enhance HIF-1α transcription. In the absence of HIF-1α, CREB is able to bind to CBP to enhance IL-10

172

production, but the contribution of miRNA is not yet known. Ultimately elevated IL-10 reduces M activation and
ultimately leads to elevated fungal burden and mouse death.
